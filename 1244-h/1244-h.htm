***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOVE FOR LOVE***
</pre>
<p>Transcribed from the 1895 Methuen and Co. edition (<i>Comedies
of William Congreve</i>, <i>Volume</i> 2) by David Price, email
ccx074@pglaf.org</p>
<h1>LOVE FOR LOVE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A COMEDY</span></h1>
<blockquote><p><i>Nudus agris</i>, <i>nudus nummis
paternis</i>,<br />
<i>Insanire parat certa ratione modoque</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Hor</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="GutSmall">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</span><br />
CHARLES, EARL OF DORSET AND MIDDLESEX,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LORD CHAMBERLAIN OF HIS MAJESTY&rsquo;S
HOUSEHOLD,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE
GARTER, ETC.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;A young poet is
liable to the same vanity and indiscretion with a young lover;
and the great man who smiles upon one, and the fine woman who
looks kindly upon t&rsquo;other, are both of &rsquo;em in danger
of having the favour published with the first opportunity.</p>
<p>But there may be a different motive, which will a little
distinguish the offenders.&nbsp; For though one should have a
vanity in ruining another&rsquo;s reputation, yet the other may
only have an ambition to advance his own.&nbsp; And I beg leave,
my lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the cause and
excuse of this dedication.</p>
<p>Whoever is king is also the father of his country; and as
nobody can dispute your lordship&rsquo;s monarchy in poetry, so
all that are concerned ought to acknowledge your universal
patronage.&nbsp; And it is only presuming on the privilege of a
loyal subject that I have ventured to make this, my address of
thanks, to your lordship, which at the same time includes a
prayer for your protection.</p>
<p>I am not ignorant of the common form of poetical dedications,
which are generally made up of panegyrics, where the authors
endeavour to distinguish their patrons, by the shining characters
they give them, above other men.&nbsp; But that, my lord, is not
my business at this time, nor is your lordship <i>now</i> to be
distinguished.&nbsp; I am contented with the honour I do myself
in this epistle without the vanity of attempting to add to or
explain your Lordships character.</p>
<p>I confess it is not without some struggling that I behave
myself in this case as I ought: for it is very hard to be pleased
with a subject, and yet forbear it.&nbsp; But I choose rather to
follow Pliny&rsquo;s precept, than his example, when, in his
panegyric to the Emperor Trajan, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati
possint</i>, <i>quam quid virtutibus debeatur</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope I may be excused the pedantry of a quotation when it is
so justly applied.&nbsp; Here are some lines in the print (and
which your lordship read before this play was acted) that were
omitted on the stage; and particularly one whole scene in the
third act, which not only helps the design forward with less
precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous character of
Foresight, which indeed seems to be maimed without it.&nbsp; But
I found myself in great danger of a long play, and was glad to
help it where I could.&nbsp; Though notwithstanding my care and
the kind reception it had from the town, I could heartily wish it
yet shorter: but the number of different characters represented
in it would have been too much crowded in less room.</p>
<p>This reflection on prolixity (a fault for which scarce any one
beauty will atone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain
your lordship any longer with the trifles of, my lord, your
lordship&rsquo;s most obedient and most humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">WILLIAM CONGREVE.</p>
<h2>PROLOGUE.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Spoken, at the opening of the new
house, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Betterton</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> husbandman in
vain renews his toil<br />
To cultivate each year a hungry soil;<br />
And fondly hopes for rich and generous fruit,<br />
When what should feed the tree devours the root;<br />
Th&rsquo; unladen boughs, he sees, bode certain dearth,<br />
Unless transplanted to more kindly earth.<br />
So the poor husbands of the stage, who found<br />
Their labours lost upon ungrateful ground,<br />
This last and only remedy have proved,<br />
And hope new fruit from ancient stocks removed.<br />
Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid,<br />
Well plant a soil which you so rich have made.<br />
As Nature gave the world to man&rsquo;s first age,<br />
So from your bounty, we receive this stage;<br />
The freedom man was born to, you&rsquo;ve restored,<br />
And to our world such plenty you afford,<br />
It seems like Eden, fruitful of its own accord.<br />
But since in Paradise frail flesh gave way,<br />
And when but two were made, both went astray;<br />
Forbear your wonder, and the fault forgive,<br />
If in our larger family we grieve<br />
One falling Adam and one tempted Eve.<br />
We who remain would gratefully repay<br />
What our endeavours can, and bring this day<br />
The first-fruit offering of a virgin play.<br />
We hope there&rsquo;s something that may please each taste,<br />
And though of homely fare we make the feast,<br />
Yet you will find variety at least.<br />
There&rsquo;s humour, which for cheerful friends we got,<br />
And for the thinking party there&rsquo;s a plot.<br />
We&rsquo;ve something, too, to gratify ill-nature,<br />
(If there be any here), and that is satire.<br />
Though satire scarce dares grin, &rsquo;tis grown so mild<br />
Or only shows its teeth, as if it smiled.<br />
As asses thistles, poets mumble wit,<br />
And dare not bite for fear of being bit:<br />
They hold their pens, as swords are held by fools,<br />
And are afraid to use their own edge-tools.<br />
Since the Plain-Dealer&rsquo;s scenes of manly rage,<br />
Not one has dared to lash this crying age.<br />
This time, the poet owns the bold essay,<br />
Yet hopes there&rsquo;s no ill-manners in his play;<br />
And he declares, by me, he has designed<br />
Affront to none, but frankly speaks his mind.<br />
And should th&rsquo; ensuing scenes not chance to hit,<br />
He offers but this one excuse, &rsquo;twas writ<br />
Before your late encouragement of wit.</p>
<h2>EPILOGUE.</h2>
<p>Spoken, at the opening of the new house, by Mrs. <span
class="smcap">Bracegirdle</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sure</span> Providence at
first designed this place<br />
To be the player&rsquo;s refuge in distress;<br />
For still in every storm they all run hither,<br />
As to a shed that shields &rsquo;em from the weather.<br />
But thinking of this change which last befel us,<br />
It&rsquo;s like what I have heard our poets tell us:<br />
For when behind our scenes their suits are pleading,<br />
To help their love, sometimes they show their reading;<br />
And, wanting ready cash to pay for hearts,<br />
They top their learning on us, and their parts.<br />
Once of philosophers they told us stories,<br />
Whom, as I think, they called&mdash;Py&mdash;Pythagories,<br />
I&rsquo;m sure &rsquo;tis some such Latin name they give
&rsquo;em,<br />
And we, who know no better, must believe &rsquo;em.<br />
Now to these men, say they, such souls were given,<br />
That after death ne&rsquo;er went to hell nor heaven,<br />
But lived, I know not how, in beasts; and then<br />
When many years were past, in men again.<br />
Methinks, we players resemble such a soul,<br />
That does from bodies, we from houses stroll.<br />
Thus Aristotle&rsquo;s soul, of old that was,<br />
May now be damned to animate an ass,<br />
Or in this very house, for ought we know,<br />
Is doing painful penance in some beau;<br />
And thus our audience, which did once resort<br />
To shining theatres to see our sport,<br />
Now find us tossed into a tennis-court.<br />
These walls but t&rsquo;other day were filled with noise<br />
Of roaring gamesters and your dam&rsquo;me boys;<br />
Then bounding balls and rackets they encompast,<br />
And now they&rsquo;re filled with jests, and flights, and
bombast!<br />
I vow, I don&rsquo;t much like this transmigration,<br />
Strolling from place to place by circulation;<br />
Grant heaven, we don&rsquo;t return to our first station!<br />
I know not what these think, but for my part<br />
I can&rsquo;t reflect without an aching heart,<br />
How we should end in our original, a cart.<br />
But we can&rsquo;t fear, since you&rsquo;re so good to save
us,<br />
That you have only set us up, to leave us.<br />
Thus from the past we hope for future grace,<br />
I beg it&mdash;<br />
And some here know I have a begging face.<br />
Then pray continue this your kind behaviour,<br />
For a clear stage won&rsquo;t do, without your favour.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">The Scene in London.</p>
<h2>ACT I.&mdash;SCENE I.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Valentine</span> <i>in his chamber
reading</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>
<i>waiting</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Several books upon the
table</i>.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Jeremy.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Here, take away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll walk a turn and
digest what I have read.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll grow devilish fat upon this paper
diet.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>, <i>and taking away the books</i>.]</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; And d&rsquo;ye hear, go you to breakfast.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a page doubled down in Epictetus, that is a feast
for an emperor.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Was Epictetus a real cook, or did he only write
receipts?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Read, read, sirrah, and refine your appetite; learn
to live upon instruction; feast your mind and mortify your flesh;
read, and take your nourishment in at your eyes; shut up your
mouth, and chew the cud of understanding.&nbsp; So Epictetus
advises.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp; I have heard much of him, when I
waited upon a gentleman at Cambridge.&nbsp; Pray what was that
Epictetus?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; A very rich man.&mdash;Not worth a groat.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Humph, and so he has made a very fine feast, where
there is nothing to be eaten?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, you&rsquo;re a gentleman, and probably
understand this fine feeding: but if you please, I had rather be
at board wages.&nbsp; Does your Epictetus, or your Seneca here,
or any of these poor rich rogues, teach you how to pay your debts
without money?&nbsp; Will they shut up the mouths of your
creditors?&nbsp; Will Plato be bail for you?&nbsp; Or Diogenes,
because he understands confinement, and lived in a tub, go to
prison for you?&nbsp; &rsquo;Slife, sir, what do you mean, to mew
yourself up here with three or four musty books, in commendation
of starving and poverty?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Why, sirrah, I have no money, you know it; and
therefore resolve to rail at all that have.&nbsp; And in that I
but follow the examples of the wisest and wittiest men in all
ages, these poets and philosophers whom you naturally hate, for
just such another reason; because they abound in sense, and you
are a fool.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Ay, sir, I am a fool, I know it: and yet, heaven
help me, I&rsquo;m poor enough to be a wit.&nbsp; But I was
always a fool when I told you what your expenses would bring you
to; your coaches and your liveries; your treats and your balls;
your being in love with a lady that did not care a farthing for
you in your prosperity; and keeping company with wits that cared
for nothing but your prosperity; and now, when you are poor, hate
you as much as they do one another.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Well, and now I am poor I have an opportunity to be
revenged on them all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pursue Angelica with more
love than ever, and appear more notoriously her admirer in this
restraint, than when I openly rivalled the rich fops that made
court to her.&nbsp; So shall my poverty be a mortification to her
pride, and, perhaps, make her compassionate the love which has
principally reduced me to this lowness of fortune.&nbsp; And for
the wits, I&rsquo;m sure I am in a condition to be even with
them.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Nay, your condition is pretty even with theirs,
that&rsquo;s the truth on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take some of their trade out of their
hands.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Now heaven of mercy continue the tax upon
paper.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean to write?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Yes, I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write a play.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Hem!&nbsp; Sir, if you please to give me a small
certificate of three lines&mdash;only to certify those whom it
may concern, that the bearer hereof, Jeremy Fetch by name, has
for the space of seven years truly and faithfully served
Valentine Legend, Esq., and that he is not now turned away for
any misdemeanour, but does voluntarily dismiss his master from
any future authority over him&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; No, sirrah; you shall live with me still.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, it&rsquo;s impossible.&nbsp; I may die with
you, starve with you, or be damned with your works.&nbsp; But to
live, even three days, the life of a play, I no more expect it
than to be canonised for a muse after my decease.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You are witty, you rogue.&nbsp; I shall want your
help.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have you learn to make couplets to tag the
ends of acts.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear?&nbsp; Get the maids to
Crambo in an evening, and learn the knack of rhyming: you may
arrive at the height of a song sent by an unknown hand, or a
chocolate-house lampoon.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; But, sir, is this the way to recover your
father&rsquo;s favour?&nbsp; Why, Sir Sampson will be
irreconcilable.&nbsp; If your younger brother should come from
sea, he&rsquo;d never look upon you again.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
undone, sir; you&rsquo;re ruined; you won&rsquo;t have a friend
left in the world if you turn poet.&nbsp; Ah, pox confound that
Will&rsquo;s coffee-house: it has ruined more young men than the
Royal Oak lottery.&nbsp; Nothing thrives that belongs
to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The man of the house would have been an
alderman by this time, with half the trade, if he had set up in
the city.&nbsp; For my part, I never sit at the door that I
don&rsquo;t get double the stomach that I do at a horse
race.&nbsp; The air upon Banstead-Downs is nothing to it for a
whetter; yet I never see it, but the spirit of famine appears to
me, sometimes like a decayed porter, worn out with pimping, and
carrying <i>billet doux</i> and songs: not like other porters,
for hire, but for the jests&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; Now like a thin
chairman, melted down to half his proportion, with carrying a
poet upon tick, to visit some great fortune; and his fare to be
paid him like the wages of sin, either at the day of marriage, or
the day of death.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Very well, sir; can you proceed?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sometimes like a bilked bookseller, with a meagre
terrified countenance, that looks as if he had written for
himself, or were resolved to turn author, and bring the rest of
his brethren into the same condition.&nbsp; And lastly, in the
form of a worn-out punk, with verses in her hand, which her
vanity had preferred to settlements, without a whole tatter to
her tail, but as ragged as one of the muses; or as if she were
carrying her linen to the paper-mill, to be converted into folio
books of warning to all young maids, not to prefer poetry to good
sense, or lying in the arms of a needy wit, before the embraces
of a wealthy fool.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>, <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; What, Jeremy holding forth?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; The rogue has (with all the wit he could muster up)
been declaiming against wit.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Ay?&nbsp; Why, then, I&rsquo;m afraid Jeremy has
wit: for wherever it is, it&rsquo;s always contriving its own
ruin.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Why, so I have been telling my master, sir: Mr.
Scandal, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, sir, try if you can dissuade
him from turning poet.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Poet!&nbsp; He shall turn soldier first, and
rather depend upon the outside of his head than the lining.&nbsp;
Why, what the devil, has not your poverty made you enemies
enough?&nbsp; Must you needs shew your wit to get more?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Ay, more indeed: for who cares for anybody that
has more wit than himself?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Jeremy speaks like an oracle.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you see how worthless great men and dull rich rogues avoid a
witty man of small fortune?&nbsp; Why, he looks like a writ of
enquiry into their titles and estates, and seems commissioned by
heaven to seize hte better half.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Therefore I would rail in my writings, and be
revenged.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Rail?&nbsp; At whom?&nbsp; The whole world?&nbsp;
Impotent and vain!&nbsp; Who would die a martyr to sense in a
country where the religion is folly?&nbsp; You may stand at bay
for a while; but when the full cry is against you, you
shan&rsquo;t have fair play for your life.&nbsp; If you
can&rsquo;t be fairly run down by the hounds, you will be
treacherously shot by the huntsmen.&nbsp; No, turn pimp,
flatterer, quack, lawyer, parson, be chaplain to an atheist, or
stallion to an old woman, anything but poet.&nbsp; A modern poet
is worse, more servile, timorous, and fawning, than any I have
named: without you could retrieve the ancient honours of the
name, recall the stage of Athens, and be allowed the force of
open honest satire.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You are as inveterate against our poets as if your
character had been lately exposed upon the stage.&nbsp; Nay, I am
not violently bent upon the trade.&nbsp; [<i>One
knocks</i>.]&nbsp; Jeremy, see who&rsquo;s there.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Jer</span>. <i>goes to the door</i>.]&nbsp; But
tell me what you would have me do?&nbsp; What do the world say of
me, and my forced confinement?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; The world behaves itself as it uses to do on such
occasions; some pity you, and condemn your father; others excuse
him, and blame you; only the ladies are merciful, and wish you
well, since love and pleasurable expense have been your greatest
faults.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Nothing new, sir; I have despatched some half a
dozen duns with as much dexterity as a hungry judge does causes
at dinner-time.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What answer have you given &rsquo;em?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Patience, I suppose, the old receipt.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; No, faith, sir; I have put &rsquo;em off so long
with patience and forbearance, and other fair words, that I was
forced now to tell &rsquo;em in plain downright
English&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; That they should be paid.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; When?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; To-morrow.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; And how the devil do you mean to keep your
word?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Keep it?&nbsp; Not at all; it has been so very
much stretched that I reckon it will break of course by
to-morrow, and nobody be surprised at the matter.&nbsp;
[<i>Knocking</i>.]&nbsp; Again!&nbsp; Sir, if you don&rsquo;t
like my negotiation, will you be pleased to answer these
yourself?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; See who they are.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

class="smcap">Scandal</span>.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; By this, Scandal, you may see what it is to be
great; secretaries of state, presidents of the council, and
generals of an army lead just such a life as I do; have just such
crowds of visitants in a morning, all soliciting of past
promises; which are but a civiller sort of duns, that lay claim
to voluntary debts.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; And you, like a true great man, having engaged
their attendance, and promised more than ever you intended to
perform, are more perplexed to find evasions than you would be to
invent the honest means of keeping your word, and gratifying your
creditors.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Scandal, learn to spare your friends, and do not
provoke your enemies; this liberty of your tongue will one day
bring a confinement on your body, my friend.</p>

class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; O sir, there&rsquo;s Trapland the scrivener, with
two suspicious fellows like lawful pads, that would knock a man
down with pocket-tipstaves.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s your
father&rsquo;s steward, and the nurse with one of your children
from Twitnam.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Pox on her, could she find no other time to fling
my sins in my face?&nbsp; Here, give her this, [<i>gives
money</i>] and bid her trouble me no more; a thoughtless
two-handed whore, she knows my condition well enough, and might
have overlaid the child a fortnight ago, if she had had any
forecast in her.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; What, is it bouncing Margery, with my godson?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; My blessing to the boy, with this token [<i>gives
money</i>] of my love.&nbsp; And d&rsquo;ye hear, bid Margery put
more flocks in her bed, shift twice a week, and not work so hard,
that she may not smell so vigorously.&nbsp; I shall take the air
shortly.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Scandal, don&rsquo;t spoil my boy&rsquo;s
milk.&nbsp; Bid Trapland come in.&nbsp; If I can give that
Cerberus a sop, I shall be at rest for one day.</p>

class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>, <span
class="smcap">Trapland</span>, <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Trapland!&nbsp; My old friend!&nbsp;
Welcome.&nbsp; Jeremy, a chair quickly: a bottle of sack and a
toast&mdash;fly&mdash;a chair first.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; A good morning to you, Mr. Valentine, and to you,
Mr. Scandal.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; The morning&rsquo;s a very good morning, if you
don&rsquo;t spoil it.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Come, sit you down, you know his way.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; [<i>sits</i>.]&nbsp; There is a debt, Mr.
Valentine, of &pound;1500 of pretty long standing&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I cannot talk about business with a thirsty
palate.&nbsp; Sirrah, the sack.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; And I desire to know what course you have taken
for the payment?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Faith and troth, I am heartily glad to see
you.&nbsp; My service to you.&nbsp; Fill, fill to honest Mr.
Trapland&mdash;fuller.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Hold, sweetheart: this is not to our
business.&nbsp; My service to you, Mr. Scandal.&nbsp;
[<i>Drinks</i>.]&nbsp; I have forborne as long&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; T&rsquo;other glass, and then we&rsquo;ll
talk.&nbsp; Fill, Jeremy.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; No more, in truth.&nbsp; I have forborne, I
say&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Sirrah, fill when I bid you.&nbsp; And how does
your handsome daughter?&nbsp; Come, a good husband to her.&nbsp;
[<i>Drinks</i>.]</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I have been out of this
money&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Drink first.&nbsp; Scandal, why do you not
drink?&nbsp; [<i>They drink</i>.]</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; And, in short, I can be put off no longer.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I was much obliged to you for your supply.&nbsp; It
did me signal service in my necessity.&nbsp; But you delight in
doing good.&nbsp; Scandal, drink to me, my friend
Trapland&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; An honester man lives not, nor one
more ready to serve his friend in distress: though I say it to
his face.&nbsp; Come, fill each man his glass.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; What, I know Trapland has been a whoremaster, and
loves a wench still.&nbsp; You never knew a whoremaster that was
not an honest fellow.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Fie, Mr. Scandal, you never knew&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; What don&rsquo;t I know?&nbsp; I know the buxom
black widow in the Poultry.&nbsp; &pound;800 a year jointure, and
&pound;20,000 in money.&nbsp; Aha! old Trap.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Say you so, i&rsquo;faith?&nbsp; Come, we&rsquo;ll
remember the widow.&nbsp; I know whereabouts you are; come, to
the widow&mdash;</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; No more, indeed.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What, the widow&rsquo;s health; give it
him&mdash;off with it.&nbsp; [<i>They drink</i>.]&nbsp; A lovely
girl, i&rsquo;faith, black sparkling eyes, soft pouting ruby
lips!&nbsp; Better sealing there than a bond for a million,
ha?</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; No, no, there&rsquo;s no such thing; we&rsquo;d
better mind our business.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a wag.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; No, faith, we&rsquo;ll mind the widow&rsquo;s
business: fill again.&nbsp; Pretty round heaving breasts, a
Barbary shape, and a jut with her bum would stir an anchoret: and
the prettiest foot!&nbsp; Oh, if a man could but fasten his eyes
to her feet as they steal in and out, and play at bo-peep under
her petticoats, ah!&nbsp; Mr. Trapland?</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Verily, give me a glass.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a
wag,&mdash;and here&rsquo;s to the widow.&nbsp;
[<i>Drinks</i>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; He begins to chuckle; ply him close, or
he&rsquo;ll relapse into a dun.</p>
<h3>SCENE VI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Officer</span>.</p>
<p>OFF.&nbsp; By your leave, gentlemen: Mr. Trapland, if we must
do our office, tell us.&nbsp; We have half a dozen gentlemen to
arrest in Pall Mall and Covent Garden; and if we don&rsquo;t make
haste the chairmen will be abroad, and block up the
chocolate-houses, and then our labour&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Udso that&rsquo;s true: Mr. Valentine, I love
mirth, but business must be done.&nbsp; Are you ready
to&mdash;</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, your father&rsquo;s steward says he comes to
make proposals concerning your debts.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Bid him come in: Mr. Trapland, send away your
officer; you shall have an answer presently.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Mr. Snap, stay within call.</p>

<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a dog now, a traitor in his wine:
sirrah, refund the sack.&mdash;Jeremy, fetch him some warm water,
or I&rsquo;ll rip up his stomach, and go the shortest way to his
conscience.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, you are uncivil; I did not value your
sack; but you cannot expect it again when I have drunk it.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; And how do you expect to have your money again
when a gentleman has spent it?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You need say no more, I understand the conditions;
they are very hard, but my necessity is very pressing: I agree to
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Take Mr. Trapland with you, and let him draw the
writing.&nbsp; Mr. Trapland, you know this man: he shall satisfy
you.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; Sincerely, I am loth to be thus pressing, but my
necessity&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; No apology, good Mr. Scrivener, you shall be
paid.</p>
<p>TRAP.&nbsp; I hope you forgive me; my business
requires&mdash;</p>
<h3>SCENE VIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; He begs pardon like a hangman at an execution.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; But I have got a reprieve.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I am surprised; what, does your father relent?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; No; he has sent me the hardest conditions in the
world.&nbsp; You have heard of a booby brother of mine that was
sent to sea three years ago?&nbsp; This brother, my father hears,
is landed; whereupon he very affectionately sends me word; if I
will make a deed of conveyance of my right to his estate, after
his death, to my younger brother, he will immediately furnish me
with four thousand pounds to pay my debts and make my
fortune.&nbsp; This was once proposed before, and I refused it;
but the present impatience of my creditors for their money, and
my own impatience of confinement, and absence from Angelica,
force me to consent.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; A very desperate demonstration of your love to
Angelica; and I think she has never given you any assurance of
hers.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You know her temper; she never gave me any great
reason either for hope or despair.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Women of her airy temper, as they seldom think
before they act, so they rarely give us any light to guess at
what they mean.&nbsp; But you have little reason to believe that
a woman of this age, who has had an indifference for you in your
prosperity, will fall in love with your ill-fortune; besides,
Angelica has a great fortune of her own; and great fortunes
either expect another great fortune, or a fool.</p>
<h3>SCENE IX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; More misfortunes, sir.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What, another dun?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; No, sir, but Mr. Tattle is come to wait upon
you.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Well, I can&rsquo;t help it, you must bring him up;
he knows I don&rsquo;t go abroad.</p>
<h3>SCENE X.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Pox on him, I&rsquo;ll be gone.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; No, prithee stay: Tattle and you should never be
asunder; you are light and shadow, and show one another; he is
perfectly thy reverse both in humour and understanding; and as
you set up for defamation, he is a mender of reputations.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; A mender of reputations!&nbsp; Ay, just as he is a
keeper of secrets, another virtue that he sets up for in the same
manner.&nbsp; For the rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a
whisper, and deny a woman&rsquo;s name while he gives you the
marks of her person.&nbsp; He will forswear receiving a letter
from her, and at the same time show you her hand in the
superscription: and yet perhaps he has counterfeited the hand
too, and sworn to a truth; but he hopes not to be believed, and
refuses the reputation of a lady&rsquo;s favour, as a Doctor says
no to a Bishopric only that it may be granted him.&nbsp; In
short, he is public professor of secrecy, and makes proclamation
that he holds private intelligence.&mdash;He&rsquo;s here.</p>
<h3>SCENE XI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Tattle</span>.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Valentine, good morrow; Scandal, I am
yours:&mdash;that is, when you speak well of me.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; That is, when I am yours; for while I am my own,
or anybody&rsquo;s else, that will never happen.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; How inhuman!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Why Tattle, you need not be much concerned at
anything that he says: for to converse with Scandal, is to play
at losing loadum; you must lose a good name to him before you can
win it for yourself.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; But how barbarous that is, and how unfortunate for
him, that the world shall think the better of any person for his
calumniation!&nbsp; I thank heaven, it has always been a part of
my character to handle the reputations of others very tenderly
indeed.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Ay, such rotten reputations as you have to deal
with are to be handled tenderly indeed.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Nay, but why rotten?&nbsp; Why should you say
rotten, when you know not the persons of whom you speak?&nbsp;
How cruel that is!</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Not know &rsquo;em?&nbsp; Why, thou never
had&rsquo;st to do with anybody that did not stink to all the
town.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha; nay, now you make a jest of it
indeed.&nbsp; For there is nothing more known than that nobody
knows anything of that nature of me.&nbsp; As I hope to be saved,
Valentine, I never exposed a woman, since I knew what woman
was.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; And yet you have conversed with several.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; To be free with you, I have.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
care if I own that.&nbsp; Nay more (I&rsquo;m going to say a bold
word now) I never could meddle with a woman that had to do with
anybody else.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Nay faith, I&rsquo;m apt to believe him.&nbsp;
Except her husband, Tattle.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, that&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; What think you of that noble commoner, Mrs.
Drab?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Pooh, I know Madam Drab has made her brags in
three or four places, that I said this and that, and writ to her,
and did I know not what&mdash;but, upon my reputation, she did me
wrong&mdash;well, well, that was malice&mdash;but I know the
bottom of it.&nbsp; She was bribed to that by one we all
know&mdash;a man too.&nbsp; Only to bring me into disgrace with a
certain woman of quality&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Whom we all know.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No matter for that.&nbsp; Yes, yes, everybody
knows.&nbsp; No doubt on&rsquo;t, everybody knows my
secrets.&nbsp; But I soon satisfied the lady of my innocence; for
I told her: Madam, says I, there are some persons who make it
their business to tell stories, and say this and that of one and
t&rsquo;other, and everything in the world; and, says I, if your
grace&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Grace!</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O Lord, what have I said?&nbsp; My unlucky
tongue!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Why, Tattle, thou hast more impudence than one can
in reason expect: I shall have an esteem for thee, well, and, ha,
ha, ha, well, go on, and what did you say to her grace?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I confess this is something extraordinary.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Not a word, as I hope to be saved; an errant
<i>lapsus lingu&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s talk of
something else.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Well, but how did you acquit yourself?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Pooh, pooh, nothing at all; I only rallied with
you&mdash;a woman of ordinary rank was a little jealous of me,
and I told her something or other, faith I know not
what.&mdash;Come, let&rsquo;s talk of something else.&nbsp;
[<i>Hums a song</i>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Hang him, let him alone, he has a mind we should
enquire.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Valentine, I supped last night with your mistress,
and her uncle, old Foresight: I think your father lies at
Foresight&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Upon my soul, Angelica&rsquo;s a fine woman.&nbsp;
And so is Mrs. Foresight, and her sister, Mrs. Frail.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Frail is a very fine woman, we all know
her.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, that is not fair.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; To tell.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; To tell what?&nbsp; Why, what do you know of Mrs.
Frail?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Who, I?&nbsp; Upon honour I don&rsquo;t know
whether she be man or woman, but by the smoothness of her chin
and roundness of her hips.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; She says otherwise.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Impossible!</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, faith.&nbsp; Ask Valentine else.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Why then, as I hope to be saved, I believe a woman
only obliges a man to secrecy that she may have the pleasure of
telling herself.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No doubt on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, but has she done
you wrong, or no?&nbsp; You have had her?&nbsp; Ha?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Though I have more honour than to tell first, I
have more manners than to contradict what a lady has
declared.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well, you own it?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I am strangely surprised!&nbsp; Yes, yes, I
can&rsquo;t deny&rsquo;t if she taxes me with it.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be here by and by, she sees Valentine
every morning.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; She does me the favour, I mean, of a visit
sometimes.&nbsp; I did not think she had granted more to
anybody.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Nor I, faith.&nbsp; But Tattle does not use to
bely a lady; it is contrary to his character.&nbsp; How one may
be deceived in a woman, Valentine?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Nay, what do you mean, gentlemen?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m resolved I&rsquo;ll ask her.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O barbarous!&nbsp; Why did you not tell me?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No; you told us.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; And bid me ask Valentine?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What did I say?&nbsp; I hope you won&rsquo;t bring
me to confess an answer when you never asked me the question?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; But, gentlemen, this is the most inhuman
proceeding&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Nay, if you have known Scandal thus long, and
cannot avoid such a palpable decoy as this was, the ladies have a
fine time whose reputations are in your keeping.</p>

<p>TATT.&nbsp; Is there not a back way?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; If there were, you have more discretion than to
give Scandal such an advantage.&nbsp; Why, your running away will
prove all that he can tell her.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Scandal, you will not be so ungenerous.&nbsp; Oh,
I shall lose my reputation of secrecy for ever.&nbsp; I shall
never be received but upon public days, and my visits will never
be admitted beyond a drawing-room.&nbsp; I shall never see a
bed-chamber again, never be locked in a closet, nor run behind a
screen, or under a table: never be distinguished among the
waiting-women by the name of trusty Mr. Tattle more.&nbsp; You
will not be so cruel?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Scandal, have pity on him; he&rsquo;ll yield to any
conditions.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Any, any terms.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Come, then, sacrifice half a dozen women of good
reputation to me presently.&nbsp; Come, where are you
familiar?&nbsp; And see that they are women of quality,
too&mdash;the first quality.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very hard.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t a
baronet&rsquo;s lady pass?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, nothing under a right honourable.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, inhuman!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t expect their
names?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, their titles shall serve.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Alas, that&rsquo;s the same thing.&nbsp; Pray
spare me their titles.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll describe their
persons.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well, begin then; but take notice, if you are so
ill a painter that I cannot know the person by your picture of
her, you must be condemned, like other bad painters, to write the
name at the bottom.</p>

<p>VAL.&nbsp; Well, Lady Galloper, how does Angelica?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Angelica?&nbsp; Manners!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What, you will allow an absent lover&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll allow a lover present with
his mistress to be particular; but otherwise, I think his passion
ought to give place to his manners.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; But what if he has more passion than manners?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Then let him marry and reform.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Marriage indeed may qualify the fury of his
passion, but it very rarely mends a man&rsquo;s manners.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; You are the most mistaken in the world;
there is no creature perfectly civil but a husband.&nbsp; For in
a little time he grows only rude to his wife, and that is the
highest good breeding, for it begets his civility to other
people.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you news; but I suppose you
hear your brother Benjamin is landed?&nbsp; And my brother
Foresight&rsquo;s daughter is come out of the country: I assure
you, there&rsquo;s a match talked of by the old people.&nbsp;
Well, if he be but as great a sea-beast as she is a land-monster,
we shall have a most amphibious breed.&nbsp; The progeny will be
all otters.&nbsp; He has been bred at sea, and she has never been
out of the country.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Pox take &rsquo;em, their conjunction bodes me no
good, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Now you talk of conjunction, my brother
Foresight has cast both their nativities, and prognosticates an
admiral and an eminent justice of the peace to be the issue male
of their two bodies; &rsquo;tis the most superstitious old
fool!&nbsp; He would have persuaded me that this was an unlucky
day, and would not let me come abroad.&nbsp; But I invented a
dream, and sent him to Artimedorus for interpretation, and so
stole out to see you.&nbsp; Well, and what will you give me
now?&nbsp; Come, I must have something.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Step into the next room, and I&rsquo;ll give you
something.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Ay, we&rsquo;ll all give you something.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, what will you all give me?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Mine&rsquo;s a secret.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; I thought you would give me something that
would be a trouble to you to keep.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; And Scandal shall give you a good name.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s more than he has for
himself.&nbsp; And what will you give me, Mr. Tattle?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I?&nbsp; My soul, madam.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Pooh!&nbsp; No, I thank you, I have enough
to do to take care of my own.&nbsp; Well, but I&rsquo;ll come and
see you one of these mornings.&nbsp; I hear you have a great many
pictures.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I have a pretty good collection, at your service,
some originals.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Hang him, he has nothing but the Seasons and the
Twelve C&aelig;sars&mdash;paltry copies&mdash;and the Five
Senses, as ill-represented as they are in himself, and he himself
is the only original you will see there.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Ay, but I hear he has a closet of
beauties.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes; all that have done him favours, if you will
believe him.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Ay, let me see those, Mr. Tattle.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, madam, those are sacred to love and
contemplation.&nbsp; No man but the painter and myself was ever
blest with the sight.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, but a woman&mdash;</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Nor woman, till she consented to have her picture
there too&mdash;for then she&rsquo;s obliged to keep the
secret.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, no; come to me if you&rsquo;d see
pictures.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; You?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, faith; I can shew you your own picture, and
most of your acquaintance to the life, and as like as at
Kneller&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O lying creature!&nbsp; Valentine, does not
he lie?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe a word he says.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; No indeed, he speaks truth now.&nbsp; For as Tattle
has pictures of all that have granted him favours, he has the
pictures of all that have refused him: if satires, descriptions,
characters, and lampoons are pictures.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes; mine are most in black and white.&nbsp; And
yet there are some set out in their true colours, both men and
women.&nbsp; I can shew you pride, folly, affectation,
wantonness, inconstancy, covetousness, dissimulation, malice and
ignorance, all in one piece.&nbsp; Then I can shew you lying,
foppery, vanity, cowardice, bragging, lechery, impotence, and
ugliness in another piece; and yet one of these is a celebrated
beauty, and t&rsquo;other a professed beau.&nbsp; I have
paintings too, some pleasant enough.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s hear &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Why, I have a beau in a <i>bagnio</i>, cupping for
a complexion, and sweating for a shape.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; So.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Then I have a lady burning brandy in a cellar with
a hackney coachman.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O devil!&nbsp; Well, but that story is not
true.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I have some hieroglyphics too; I have a lawyer
with a hundred hands, two heads, and but one face; a divine with
two faces, and one head; and I have a soldier with his brains in
his belly, and his heart where his head should be.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; And no head?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No head.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Pooh, this is all invention.&nbsp; Have you
never a poet?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, I have a poet weighing words, and selling
praise for praise, and a critic picking his pocket.&nbsp; I have
another large piece too, representing a school, where there are
huge proportioned critics, with long wigs, laced coats, Steinkirk
cravats, and terrible faces; with cat-calls in their hands, and
horn-books about their necks.&nbsp; I have many more of this
kind, very well painted, as you shall see.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll come, if it be but to
disprove you.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, here&rsquo;s the steward again from your
father.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come to him&mdash;will you give me
leave?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait on you again presently.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No; I&rsquo;ll be gone.&nbsp; Come, who
squires me to the Exchange?&nbsp; I must call my sister Foresight
there.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I will: I have a mind to your sister.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Civil!</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I will: because I have a tendre for your
ladyship.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s somewhat the better reason, to
my opinion.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well, if Tattle entertains you, I have the better
opportunity to engage your sister.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Tell Angelica I am about making hard conditions to
come abroad, and be at liberty to see her.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give an account of you and your
proceedings.&nbsp; If indiscretion be a sign of love, you are the
most a lover of anybody that I know: you fancy that parting with
your estate will help you to your mistress.&nbsp; In my mind he
is a thoughtless adventurer</p>
<p class="poetry">Who hopes to purchase wealth by selling
land;<br />
Or win a mistress with a losing hand.</p>
<h2>ACT II.&mdash;SCENE I.</h2>

<p>FORE.&nbsp; Hey day!&nbsp; What, are all the women of my
family abroad?&nbsp; Is not my wife come home?&nbsp; Nor my
sister, nor my daughter?</p>
<p>SERV.&nbsp; No, sir.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Mercy on us, what can be the meaning of it?&nbsp;
Sure the moon is in all her fortitudes.&nbsp; Is my niece
Angelica at home?</p>
<p>SERV.&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I believe you lie, sir.</p>
<p>SERV.&nbsp; Sir?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I say you lie, sir.&nbsp; It is impossible that
anything should be as I would have it; for I was born, sir, when
the crab was ascending, and all my affairs go backward.</p>
<p>SERV.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell indeed, sir.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; No, I know you can&rsquo;t, sir: but I can tell,
and foretell, sir.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Nurse</span>.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Nurse, where&rsquo;s your young mistress?</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wee&rsquo;st heart, I know not,
they&rsquo;re none of &rsquo;em come home yet.&nbsp; Poor child,
I warrant she&rsquo;s fond o&rsquo; seeing the town.&nbsp; Marry,
pray heaven they ha&rsquo; given her any dinner.&nbsp; Good
lack-a-day, ha, ha, ha, Oh, strange!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll vow and
swear now, ha, ha, ha, marry, and did you ever see the like!</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Why, how now, what&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp; Pray heaven send your worship good luck, marry,
and amen with all my heart, for you have put on one stocking with
the wrong side outward.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Ha, how?&nbsp; Faith and troth I&rsquo;m glad of
it; and so I have: that may be good luck in troth, in troth it
may, very good luck.&nbsp; Nay, I have had some omens: I got out
of bed backwards too this morning, without premeditation; pretty
good that too; but then I stumbled coming down stairs, and met a
weasel; bad omens those: some bad, some good, our lives are
chequered.&nbsp; Mirth and sorrow, want and plenty, night and
day, make up our time.&nbsp; But in troth I am pleased at my
stocking; very well pleased at my stocking.&nbsp; Oh,
here&rsquo;s my niece!&nbsp; Sirrah, go tell Sir Sampson Legend
I&rsquo;ll wait on him if he&rsquo;s at leisure:&mdash;&rsquo;tis
now three o&rsquo;clock, a very good hour for business: Mercury
governs this hour.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Angelica</span>, <span
class="smcap">Foresight</span>, <span
class="smcap">Nurse</span>.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Is it not a good hour for pleasure too,
uncle?&nbsp; Pray lend me your coach; mine&rsquo;s out of
order.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; What, would you be gadding too?&nbsp; Sure, all
females are mad to-day.&nbsp; It is of evil portent, and bodes
mischief to the master of a family.&nbsp; I remember an old
prophecy written by Messahalah the Arabian, and thus translated
by a reverend Buckinghamshire bard:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;When housewives all the house
forsake,<br />
And leave goodman to brew and bake,<br />
Withouten guile, then be it said,<br />
That house doth stand upon its head;<br />
And when the head is set in grond,<br />
Ne marl, if it be fruitful fond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fruitful, the head fruitful, that bodes horns; the fruit of
the head is horns.&nbsp; Dear niece, stay at home&mdash;for by
the head of the house is meant the husband; the prophecy needs no
explanation.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Well, but I can neither make you a cuckold, uncle,
by going abroad, nor secure you from being one by staying at
home.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Yes, yes; while there&rsquo;s one woman left, the
prophecy is not in full force.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; But my inclinations are in force; I have a mind to
go abroad, and if you won&rsquo;t lend me your coach, I&rsquo;ll
take a hackney or a chair, and leave you to erect a scheme, and
find who&rsquo;s in conjunction with your wife.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you keep her at home, if you&rsquo;re jealous of her
when she&rsquo;s abroad?&nbsp; You know my aunt is a little
retrograde (as you call it) in her nature.&nbsp; Uncle, I&rsquo;m
afraid you are not lord of the ascendant, ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Well, Jill-flirt, you are very pert, and always
ridiculing that celestial science.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Nay, uncle, don&rsquo;t be angry&mdash;if you are,
I&rsquo;ll reap up all your false prophecies, ridiculous dreams,
and idle divinations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll swear you are a nuisance
to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; What a bustle did you keep against
the last invisible eclipse, laying in provision as &rsquo;twere
for a siege.&nbsp; What a world of fire and candle, matches and
tinder-boxes did you purchase!&nbsp; One would have thought we
were ever after to live under ground, or at least making a voyage
to Greenland, to inhabit there all the dark season.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Why, you malapert slut&mdash;</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Will you lend me your coach, or I&rsquo;ll go
on&mdash;nay, I&rsquo;ll declare how you prophesied popery was
coming only because the butler had mislaid some of the apostle
spoons, and thought they were lost.&nbsp; Away went religion and
spoon-meat together.&nbsp; Indeed, uncle, I&rsquo;ll indite you
for a wizard.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How, hussy!&nbsp; Was there ever such a provoking
minx?</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp; O merciful father, how she talks!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Yes, I can make oath of your unlawful midnight
practices, you and the old nurse there&mdash;</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp; Marry, heaven defend!&nbsp; I at midnight
practices?&nbsp; O Lord, what&rsquo;s here to do?&nbsp; I in
unlawful doings with my master&rsquo;s worship&mdash;why, did you
ever hear the like now?&nbsp; Sir, did ever I do anything of your
midnight concerns but warm your bed, and tuck you up, and set the
candle and your tobacco-box and your urinal by you, and now and
then rub the soles of your feet?&nbsp; O Lord, I!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Yes, I saw you together through the key-hole of the
closet one night, like Saul and the witch of Endor, turning the
sieve and shears, and pricking your thumbs, to write poor
innocent servants&rsquo; names in blood, about a little nutmeg
grater which she had forgot in the caudle-cup.&nbsp; Nay, I know
something worse, if I would speak of it.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I defy you, hussy; but I&rsquo;ll remember this,
I&rsquo;ll be revenged on you, cockatrice.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
hamper you.&nbsp; You have your fortune in your own hands, but
I&rsquo;ll find a way to make your lover, your prodigal
spendthrift gallant, Valentine, pay for all, I will.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Will you?&nbsp; I care not, but all shall out
then.&nbsp; Look to it, nurse: I can bring witness that you have
a great unnatural teat under your left arm, and he another; and
that you suckle a young devil in the shape of a tabby-cat, by
turns, I can.</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp; A teat, a teat&mdash;I an unnatural teat!&nbsp;
Oh, the false, slanderous thing; feel, feel here, if I have
anything but like another Christian.&nbsp; [<i>Crying</i>.]</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I will have patience, since it is the will of the
stars I should be thus tormented.&nbsp; This is the effect of the
malicious conjunctions and oppositions in the third house of my
nativity; there the curse of kindred was foretold.&nbsp; But I
will have my doors locked up;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll punish you: not a
man shall enter my house.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Do, uncle, lock &rsquo;em up quickly before my aunt
come home.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have a letter for alimony to-morrow
morning.&nbsp; But let me be gone first, and then let no mankind
come near the house, but converse with spirits and the celestial
signs, the bull and the ram and the goat.&nbsp; Bless me!&nbsp;
There are a great many horned beasts among the twelve signs,
uncle.&nbsp; But cuckolds go to heaven.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s but one virgin among the twelve
signs, spitfire, but one virgin.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Nor there had not been that one, if she had had to
do with anything but astrologers, uncle.&nbsp; That makes my aunt
go abroad.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How, how?&nbsp; Is that the reason?&nbsp; Come,
you know something; tell me and I&rsquo;ll forgive you.&nbsp; Do,
good niece.&nbsp; Come, you shall have my coach and
horses&mdash;faith and troth you shall.&nbsp; Does my wife
complain?&nbsp; Come, I know women tell one another.&nbsp; She is
young and sanguine, has a wanton hazel eye, and was born under
Gemini, which may incline her to society.&nbsp; She has a mole
upon her lip, with a moist palm, and an open liberality on the
mount of Venus.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Do you laugh?&nbsp; Well, gentlewoman,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;but come, be a good girl, don&rsquo;t perplex
your poor uncle, tell me&mdash;won&rsquo;t you speak?&nbsp; Odd,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;</p>
<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p>
<p>SERV.&nbsp; Sir Sampson is coming down to wait upon you.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Good-bye, uncle&mdash;call me a chair.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll find out my aunt, and tell her she must not come
home.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so perplexed and vexed, I&rsquo;m not
fit to receive him; I shall scarce recover myself before the hour
be past.&nbsp; Go nurse, tell Sir Sampson I&rsquo;m ready to wait
on him.</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp; Yes, sir,</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Well&mdash;why, if I was born to be a cuckold,
there&rsquo;s no more to be said&mdash;he&rsquo;s here
already.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Foresight</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Sir Sampson Legend</span> <i>with a paper</i>.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Nor no more to be done, old boy; that&rsquo;s
plain&mdash;here &rsquo;tis, I have it in my hand, old Ptolomey,
I&rsquo;ll make the ungracious prodigal know who begat him; I
will, old Nostrodamus.&nbsp; What, I warrant my son thought
nothing belonged to a father but forgiveness and affection; no
authority, no correction, no arbitrary power; nothing to be done,
but for him to offend and me to pardon.&nbsp; I warrant you, if
he danced till doomsday he thought I was to pay the piper.&nbsp;
Well, but here it is under black and white, <i>signatum</i>,
<i>sigillatum</i>, and <i>deliberatum</i>; that as soon as my son
Benjamin is arrived, he&rsquo;s to make over to him his right of
inheritance.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my daughter that is to
be?&mdash;Hah! old Merlin! body o&rsquo; me, I&rsquo;m so glad
I&rsquo;m revenged on this undutiful rogue.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Odso, let me see; let me see the paper.&nbsp; Ay,
faith and troth, here &rsquo;tis, if it will but hold.&nbsp; I
wish things were done, and the conveyance made.&nbsp; When was
this signed, what hour?&nbsp; Odso, you should have consulted me
for the time.&nbsp; Well, but we&rsquo;ll make haste&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Haste, ay, ay; haste enough.&nbsp; My son Ben
will be in town to-night.&nbsp; I have ordered my lawyer to draw
up writings of settlement and jointure&mdash;all shall be done
to-night.&nbsp; No matter for the time; prithee, brother
Foresight, leave superstition.&nbsp; Pox o&rsquo; the time;
there&rsquo;s no time but the time present, there&rsquo;s no more
to be said of what&rsquo;s past, and all that is to come will
happen.&nbsp; If the sun shine by day, and the stars by night,
why, we shall know one another&rsquo;s faces without the help of
a candle, and that&rsquo;s all the stars are good for.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How, how?&nbsp; Sir Sampson, that all?&nbsp; Give
me leave to contradict you, and tell you you are ignorant.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; I tell you I am wise; and <i>sapiens
dominabitur astris</i>; there&rsquo;s Latin for you to prove it,
and an argument to confound your Ephemeris.&mdash;Ignorant!&nbsp;
I tell you, I have travelled old Fircu, and know the globe.&nbsp;
I have seen the antipodes, where the sun rises at midnight, and
sets at noon-day.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; But I tell you, I have travelled, and travelled in
the celestial spheres, know the signs and the planets, and their
houses.&nbsp; Can judge of motions direct and retrograde, of
sextiles, quadrates, trines and oppositions, fiery-trigons and
aquatical-trigons.&nbsp; Know whether life shall be long or
short, happy or unhappy, whether diseases are curable or
incurable.&nbsp; If journeys shall be prosperous, undertakings
successful, or goods stolen recovered; I know&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; I know the length of the Emperor of
China&rsquo;s foot; have kissed the Great Mogul&rsquo;s slippers,
and rid a-hunting upon an elephant with a Cham of Tartary.&nbsp;
Body o&rsquo; me, I have made a cuckold of a king, and the
present majesty of Bantam is the issue of these loins.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I know when travellers lie or speak truth, when
they don&rsquo;t know it themselves.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; I have known an astrologer made a cuckold in
the twinkling of a star; and seen a conjurer that could not keep
the devil out of his wife&rsquo;s circle.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; What, does he twit me with my wife too?&nbsp; I
must be better informed of this.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Do
you mean my wife, Sir Sampson?&nbsp; Though you made a cuckold of
the king of Bantam, yet by the body of the sun&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; By the horns of the moon, you would say,
brother Capricorn.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Capricorn in your teeth, thou modern Mandeville;
Ferdinand Mendez Pinto was but a type of thee, thou liar of the
first magnitude.&nbsp; Take back your paper of inheritance; send
your son to sea again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wed my daughter to an
Egyptian mummy, e&rsquo;er she shall incorporate with a contemner
of sciences, and a defamer of virtue.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, I have gone too far; I must
not provoke honest Albumazar:&mdash;an Egyptian mummy is an
illustrious creature, my trusty hieroglyphic; and may have
significations of futurity about him; odsbud, I would my son were
an Egyptian mummy for thy sake.&nbsp; What, thou art not angry
for a jest, my good Haly?&nbsp; I reverence the sun, moon and
stars with all my heart.&nbsp; What, I&rsquo;ll make thee a
present of a mummy: now I think on&rsquo;t, body o&rsquo; me, I
have a shoulder of an Egyptian king that I purloined from one of
the pyramids, powdered with hieroglyphics, thou shalt have it
brought home to thy house, and make an entertainment for all the
philomaths, and students in physic and astrology in and about
London.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; But what do you know of my wife, Sir Sampson?</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Thy wife is a constellation of virtues;
she&rsquo;s the moon, and thou art the man in the moon.&nbsp;
Nay, she is more illustrious than the moon; for she has her
chastity without her inconstancy: &rsquo;sbud I was but in
jest.</p>

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; How now, who sent for you?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;
What would you have?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Nay, if you were but in jest&mdash;who&rsquo;s
that fellow?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like his physiognomy.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; My son, sir; what son, sir?&nbsp; My son
Benjamin, hoh?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; No, sir, Mr. Valentine, my master; &rsquo;tis the

to pay his duty to you.</p>

Sampson</span>, <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span

<p>JERE.&nbsp; He is here, sir.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Your blessing, sir.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had it already, sir; I think I
sent it you to-day in a bill of four thousand pound: a great deal
of money, brother Foresight.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Ay, indeed, Sir Sampson, a great deal of money for
a young man; I wonder what he can do with it!</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, so do I.&nbsp; Hark ye,
Valentine, if there be too much, refund the superfluity; dost
hear, boy?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Superfluity, sir?&nbsp; It will scarce pay my
debts.&nbsp; I hope you will have more indulgence than to oblige
me to those hard conditions which my necessity signed to.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Sir, how, I beseech you, what were you pleased
to intimate, concerning indulgence?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Why, sir, that you would not go to the extremity of
the conditions, but release me at least from some part.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Oh, sir, I understand you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all, ha?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Yes, sir, all that I presume to ask.&nbsp; But what
you, out of fatherly fondness, will be pleased to add, shall be
doubly welcome.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; No doubt of it, sweet sir; but your filial
piety, and my fatherly fondness would fit like two tallies.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s a rogue, brother Foresight, makes a bargain under
hand and seal in the morning, and would be released from it in
the afternoon; here&rsquo;s a rogue, dog, here&rsquo;s conscience
and honesty; this is your wit now, this is the morality of your
wits!&nbsp; You are a wit, and have been a beau, and may be
a&mdash;why sirrah, is it not here under hand and seal&mdash;can
you deny it?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Sir, I don&rsquo;t deny it.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Sirrah, you&rsquo;ll be hanged; I shall live
to see you go up Holborn Hill.&nbsp; Has he not a rogue&rsquo;s
face?&nbsp; Speak brother, you understand physiognomy, a hanging
look to me&mdash;of all my boys the most unlike me; he has a
damned Tyburn face, without the benefit o&rsquo; the clergy.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Hum&mdash;truly I don&rsquo;t care to discourage a
young man,&mdash;he has a violent death in his face; but I hope
no danger of hanging.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Sir, is this usage for your son?&mdash;For that old
weather-headed fool, I know how to laugh at him; but you,
sir&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; You, sir; and you, sir: why, who are you,
sir?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Your son, sir.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s more than I know, sir, and I
believe not.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Faith, I hope not.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; What, would you have your mother a
whore?&nbsp; Did you ever hear the like?&nbsp; Did you ever hear
the like?&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I would have an excuse for your barbarity and
unnatural usage.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Excuse!&nbsp; Impudence!&nbsp; Why, sirrah,
mayn&rsquo;t I do what I please?&nbsp; Are not you my
slave?&nbsp; Did not I beget you?&nbsp; And might not I have
chosen whether I would have begot you or no?&nbsp; &rsquo;Oons,
who are you?&nbsp; Whence came you?&nbsp; What brought you into
the world?&nbsp; How came you here, sir?&nbsp; Here, to stand
here, upon those two legs, and look erect with that audacious
face, ha?&nbsp; Answer me that!&nbsp; Did you come a volunteer
into the world?&nbsp; Or did I, with the lawful authority of a
parent, press you to the service?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I know no more why I came than you do why you
called me.&nbsp; But here I am, and if you don&rsquo;t mean to
provide for me, I desire you would leave me as you found me.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; With all my heart: come, uncase, strip, and go
naked out of the world as you came into &rsquo;t.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; My clothes are soon put off.&nbsp; But you must
also divest me of reason, thought, passions, inclinations,
affections, appetites, senses, and the huge train of attendants
that you begot along with me.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, what a manyheaded monster
have I propagated!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I am of myself, a plain, easy, simple creature, and
to be kept at small expense; but the retinue that you gave me are
craving and invincible; they are so many devils that you have
raised, and will have employment.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; &rsquo;Oons, what had I to do to get
children,&mdash;can&rsquo;t a private man be born without all
these followers?&nbsp; Why, nothing under an emperor should be
born with appetites.&nbsp; Why, at this rate, a fellow that has
but a groat in his pocket may have a stomach capable of a ten
shilling ordinary.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Nay, that&rsquo;s as clear as the sun; I&rsquo;ll
make oath of it before any justice in Middlesex.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a cormorant too.&nbsp;
&rsquo;S&rsquo;heart this fellow was not born with you?&nbsp; I
did not beget him, did I?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; By the provision that&rsquo;s made for me, you
might have begot me too.&nbsp; Nay, and to tell your worship
another truth, I believe you did, for I find I was born with
those same whoreson appetites too, that my master speaks of.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Why, look you there, now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
maintain it, that by the rule of right reason, this fellow ought
to have been born without a palate.&nbsp; &rsquo;S&rsquo;heart,
what should he do with a distinguishing taste?&nbsp; I warrant
now he&rsquo;d rather eat a pheasant, than a piece of poor John;
and smell, now, why I warrant he can smell, and loves perfumes
above a stink.&nbsp; Why there&rsquo;s it; and music, don&rsquo;t
you love music, scoundrel?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Yes; I have a reasonable good ear, sir, as to jigs
and country dances, and the like; I don&rsquo;t much matter your
solos or sonatas, they give me the spleen.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; The spleen, ha, ha, ha; a pox confound
you&mdash;solos or sonatas?&nbsp; &rsquo;Oons, whose son are
you?&nbsp; How were you engendered, muckworm?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; I am by my father, the son of a chair-man; my
mother sold oysters in winter, and cucumbers in summer; and I
came upstairs into the world; for I was born in a cellar.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; By your looks, you should go upstairs out of the
world too, friend.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; And if this rogue were anatomized now, and
dissected, he has his vessels of digestion and concoction, and so
forth, large enough for the inside of a cardinal, this son of a
cucumber.&mdash;These things are unaccountable and
unreasonable.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, why was not I a bear, that
my cubs might have lived upon sucking their paws?&nbsp; Nature
has been provident only to bears and spiders; the one has its
nutriment in his own hands; and t&rsquo;other spins his
habitation out of his own entrails.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Fortune was provident enough to supply all the
necessities of my nature, if I had my right of inheritance.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Again!&nbsp; &rsquo;Oons, han&rsquo;t you four
thousand pounds?&nbsp; If I had it again, I would not give thee a
groat.&mdash;What, would&rsquo;st thou have me turn pelican, and
feed thee out of my own vitals?&nbsp; S&rsquo;heart, live by your
wits: you were always fond of the wits, now let&rsquo;s see, if
you have wit enough to keep yourself.&nbsp; Your brother will be
in town to-night or to-morrow morning, and then look you perform
covenants, and so your friend and servant:&mdash;come, brother
Foresight.</p>
<h3>SCENE VIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; I told you what your visit would come to.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as much as I expected.&nbsp; I did not
come to see him, I came to see Angelica: but since she was gone
abroad, it was easily turned another way, and at least looked
well on my side.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; Mrs. Foresight
and Mrs. Frail, they are earnest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll avoid
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Come this way, and go and enquire when Angelica
will return.</p>
<h3>SCENE IX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mrs.
Foresight</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Frail</span>.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; What have you to do to watch me?&nbsp;
&rsquo;S&rsquo;life I&rsquo;ll do what I please.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; You will?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Yes, marry will I.&nbsp; A great piece of
business to go to Covent Garden Square in a hackney coach, and
take a turn with one&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Nay, two or three turns, I&rsquo;ll take my
oath.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, what if I took twenty&mdash;I warrant
if you had been there, it had been only innocent
recreation.&nbsp; Lord, where&rsquo;s the comfort of this life if
we can&rsquo;t have the happiness of conversing where we
like?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; But can&rsquo;t you converse at home?&nbsp; I
own it, I think there&rsquo;s no happiness like conversing with
an agreeable man; I don&rsquo;t quarrel at that, nor I
don&rsquo;t think but your conversation was very innocent; but
the place is public, and to be seen with a man in a hackney coach
is scandalous.&nbsp; What if anybody else should have seen you
alight, as I did?&nbsp; How can anybody be happy while
they&rsquo;re in perpetual fear of being seen and censured?&nbsp;
Besides, it would not only reflect upon you, sister, but me.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Pooh, here&rsquo;s a clutter: why should it
reflect upon you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t doubt but you have thought
yourself happy in a hackney coach before now.&nbsp; If I had gone
to Knight&rsquo;s Bridge, or to Chelsea, or to Spring Garden, or
Barn Elms with a man alone, something might have been said.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Why, was I ever in any of those places?&nbsp;
What do you mean, sister?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Was I?&nbsp; What do you mean?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; You have been at a worse place.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; I at a worse place, and with a man!</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; I suppose you would not go alone to the
World&rsquo;s End.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; The World&rsquo;s End!&nbsp; What, do you
mean to banter me?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Poor innocent!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
that there&rsquo;s a place called the World&rsquo;s End?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll swear you can keep your countenance purely:
you&rsquo;d make an admirable player.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll swear you have a great deal of
confidence, and in my mind too much for the stage.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Very well, that will appear who has most; you
never were at the World&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; You deny it positively to my face?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Your face, what&rsquo;s your face?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; No matter for that, it&rsquo;s as good a face
as yours.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Not by a dozen years&rsquo; wearing.&nbsp;
But I do deny it positively to your face, then.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll allow you now to find fault with
my face; for I&rsquo;ll swear your impudence has put me out of
countenance.&nbsp; But look you here now, where did you lose this
gold bodkin?&nbsp; Oh, sister, sister!</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; My bodkin!</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis yours, look at it.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, if you go to that, where did you find
this bodkin?&nbsp; Oh, sister, sister!&nbsp; Sister every
way.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh, devil on&rsquo;t, that I could not
discover her without betraying myself.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; I have heard gentlemen say, sister, that one
should take great care, when one makes a thrust in fencing, not
to lie open oneself.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very true, sister.&nbsp; Well,
since all&rsquo;s out, and as you say, since we are both wounded,
let us do what is often done in duels, take care of one another,
and grow better friends than before.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; With all my heart: ours are but slight flesh
wounds, and if we keep &rsquo;em from air, not at all
dangerous.&nbsp; Well, give me your hand in token of sisterly
secrecy and affection.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Here &rsquo;tis, with all my heart.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, as an earnest of friendship and
confidence, I&rsquo;ll acquaint you with a design that I
have.&nbsp; To tell truth, and speak openly one to another,
I&rsquo;m afraid the world have observed us more than we have
observed one another.&nbsp; You have a rich husband, and are
provided for.&nbsp; I am at a loss, and have no great stock
either of fortune or reputation, and therefore must look sharply
about me.&nbsp; Sir Sampson has a son that is expected to-night,
and by the account I have heard of his education, can be no
conjurer.&nbsp; The estate you know is to be made over to
him.&nbsp; Now if I could wheedle him, sister, ha?&nbsp; You
understand me?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; I do, and will help you to the utmost of my
power.&nbsp; And I can tell you one thing that falls out luckily
enough; my awkward daughter-in-law, who you know is designed to
be his wife, is grown fond of Mr. Tattle; now if we can improve
that, and make her have an aversion for the booby, it may go a
great way towards his liking you.&nbsp; Here they come together;
and let us contrive some way or other to leave &rsquo;em
together.</p>
<h3>SCENE X.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Tattle</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Prue</span>.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Mother, mother, mother, look you here!</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Fie, fie, Miss, how you bawl!&nbsp; Besides,
I have told you, you must not call me mother.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; What must I call you then, are you not my
father&rsquo;s wife?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Madam; you must say madam.&nbsp; By my soul,
I shall fancy myself old indeed to have this great girl call me
mother.&nbsp; Well, but Miss, what are you so overjoyed at?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Look you here, madam, then, what Mr. Tattle has
given me.&nbsp; Look you here, cousin, here&rsquo;s a snuff-box;
nay, there&rsquo;s snuff in&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Here, will you have
any?&nbsp; Oh, good!&nbsp; How sweet it is.&nbsp; Mr. Tattle is
all over sweet, his peruke is sweet, and his gloves are sweet,
and his handkerchief is sweet, pure sweet, sweeter than
roses.&nbsp; Smell him, mother&mdash;madam, I mean.&nbsp; He gave
me this ring for a kiss.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O fie, Miss, you must not kiss and tell.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Yes; I may tell my mother.&nbsp; And he says
he&rsquo;ll give me something to make me smell so.&nbsp; Oh, pray
lend me your handkerchief.&nbsp; Smell, cousin; he says
he&rsquo;ll give me something that will make my smocks smell this
way.&nbsp; Is not it pure?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better than lavender,
mun.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m resolved I won&rsquo;t let nurse put any
more lavender among my smocks&mdash;ha, cousin?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Fie, Miss; amongst your linen, you must
say.&nbsp; You must never say smock.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Why, it is not bawdy, is it, cousin?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, madam; you are too severe upon Miss; you must
not find fault with her pretty simplicity: it becomes her
strangely.&nbsp; Pretty Miss, don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em persuade
you out of your innocency.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh, demm you toad.&nbsp; I wish you
don&rsquo;t persuade her out of her innocency.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Who, I, madam?&nbsp; O Lord, how can your ladyship
have such a thought?&nbsp; Sure, you don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Ah devil, sly devil.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as
close, sister, as a confessor.&nbsp; He thinks we don&rsquo;t
observe him.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; A cunning cur, how soon he could find out a
fresh, harmless creature; and left us, sister, presently.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Upon reputation</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all so, sister, these
men.&nbsp; They love to have the spoiling of a young thing, they
are as fond of it, as of being first in the fashion, or of seeing
a new play the first day.&nbsp; I warrant it would break Mr.
Tattle&rsquo;s heart to think that anybody else should be
beforehand with him.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O Lord, I swear I would not for the
world&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O hang you; who&rsquo;ll believe you?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d be hanged before you&rsquo;d confess.&nbsp; We know
you&mdash;she&rsquo;s very pretty!&nbsp; Lord, what pure red and
white!&mdash;she looks so wholesome; ne&rsquo;er stir: I
don&rsquo;t know, but I fancy, if I were a man&mdash;</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; How you love to jeer one, cousin.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Hark&rsquo;ee, sister, by my soul the girl is
spoiled already.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ee think she&rsquo;ll ever endure
a great lubberly tarpaulin?&nbsp; Gad, I warrant you she
won&rsquo;t let him come near her after Mr. Tattle.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O my soul, I&rsquo;m afraid
not&mdash;eh!&mdash;filthy creature, that smells all of pitch and
tar.&nbsp; Devil take you, you confounded toad&mdash;why did you
see her before she was married?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Nay, why did we let him&mdash;my husband will
hang us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll think we brought &rsquo;em
acquainted.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Come, faith, let us be gone.&nbsp; If my
brother Foresight should find us with them, he&rsquo;d think so,
sure enough.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; So he would&mdash;but then leaving them
together is as bad: and he&rsquo;s such a sly devil, he&rsquo;ll
never miss an opportunity.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care; I won&rsquo;t be seen
in&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Well, if you should, Mr. Tattle, you&rsquo;ll
have a world to answer for; remember I wash my hands of it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m thoroughly innocent.</p>
<h3>SCENE XI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Tattle</span>,
<span class="smcap">Miss Prue</span>.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; What makes &rsquo;em go away, Mr. Tattle?&nbsp;
What do they mean, do you know?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Yes my dear; I think I can guess, but hang me if I
know the reason of it.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Come, must not we go too?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, no, they don&rsquo;t mean that.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; What shall you and I do
together?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I must make love to you, pretty Miss; will you let
me make love to you?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Yes, if you please.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Frank, i&rsquo;Gad, at least.&nbsp; What a pox
does Mrs. Foresight mean by this civility?&nbsp; Is it to make a
fool of me?&nbsp; Or does she leave us together out of good
morality, and do as she would be done by?&mdash;Gad, I&rsquo;ll
understand it so.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Well; and how will you make love to me&mdash;come,
I long to have you begin,&mdash;must I make love too?&nbsp; You
must tell me how.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; You must let me speak, Miss, you must not speak
first; I must ask you questions, and you must answer.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; What, is it like the catechism?&nbsp; Come then,
ask me.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think you can love me?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Pooh, pox, you must not say yes already; I
shan&rsquo;t care a farthing for you then in a twinkling.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; What must I say then?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Why you must say no, or you believe not, or you
can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Why, must I tell a lie then?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Yes, if you&rsquo;d be well bred.&nbsp; All well
bred persons lie.&mdash;Besides, you are a woman, you must never
speak what you think: your words must contradict your thoughts;
but your actions may contradict your words.&nbsp; So when I ask
you if you can love me, you must say no, but you must love me
too.&nbsp; If I tell you you are handsome, you must deny it, and
say I flatter you.&nbsp; But you must think yourself more
charming than I speak you: and like me, for the beauty which I
say you have, as much as if I had it myself.&nbsp; If I ask you
to kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not refuse me.&nbsp;
If I ask you for more, you must be more angry,&mdash;but more
complying; and as soon as ever I make you say you&rsquo;ll cry
out, you must be sure to hold your tongue.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; O Lord, I swear this is pure.&nbsp; I like it
better than our old-fashioned country way of speaking one&rsquo;s
mind;&mdash;and must not you lie too?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Hum&mdash;yes&mdash;but you must believe I speak
truth.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; O Gemini!&nbsp; Well, I always had a great mind to
tell lies; but they frighted me, and said it was a sin.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Well, my pretty creature; will you make me happy
by giving me a kiss?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; No, indeed; I&rsquo;m angry at you.&nbsp; [<i>Runs
and kisses him</i>.]</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Hold, hold, that&rsquo;s pretty well, but you
should not have given it me, but have suffered me to have taken
it.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Well, we&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; With all my heart.&mdash;Now then, my little
angel.&nbsp; [<i>Kisses her</i>.]</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Pish.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right,&mdash;again, my charmer.&nbsp;
[<i>Kisses again</i>.]</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; O fie, nay, now I can&rsquo;t abide you.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Admirable!&nbsp; That was as well as if you had
been born and bred in Covent Garden.&nbsp; And won&rsquo;t you
shew me, pretty miss, where your bed-chamber is?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; No, indeed won&rsquo;t I; but I&rsquo;ll run
there, and hide myself from you behind the curtains.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll follow you.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Ah, but I&rsquo;ll hold the door with both hands,
and be angry;&mdash;and you shall push me down before you come
in.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll come in first, and push you down
afterwards.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Will you?&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll be more angry and
more complying.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll make you cry out.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Oh, but you shan&rsquo;t, for I&rsquo;ll hold my
tongue.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O my dear apt scholar!</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Well, now I&rsquo;ll run and make more haste than
you.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; You shall not fly so fast, as I&rsquo;ll
pursue.</p>

Miss, Miss Foresight!&nbsp; Sure she has locked herself up in her
chamber, and gone to sleep, or to prayers: Miss, Miss,&mdash;I
hear her.&mdash;Come to your father, child; open the door.&nbsp;
Open the door, Miss.&nbsp; I hear you cry husht.&nbsp; O Lord,
who&rsquo;s there? [<i>peeps</i>]&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here to

<p>MISS.&nbsp; O Lord, she&rsquo;s coming, and she&rsquo;ll tell
my father; what shall I do now?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Pox take her; if she had stayed two minutes
longer, I should have wished for her coming.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; O dear, what shall I say?&nbsp; Tell me, Mr.
Tattle, tell me a lie.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no occasion for a lie; I could never
tell a lie to no purpose.&nbsp; But since we have done nothing,
we must say nothing, I think.&nbsp; I hear her,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
leave you together, and come off as you can.&nbsp; [<i>Thrusts

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Tattle</span>,
<span class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>, <span
class="smcap">Angelica</span>.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t accuse me of inconstancy; I never
told you that I loved you.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; But I can accuse you of uncertainty, for not
telling me whether you did or not.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; You mistake indifference for uncertainty; I never
had concern enough to ask myself the question.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Nor good-nature enough to answer him that did ask
you; I&rsquo;ll say that for you, madam.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; What, are you setting up for good-nature?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Only for the affectation of it, as the women do
for ill-nature.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Persuade your friend that it is all
affectation.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I shall receive no benefit from the opinion; for I
know no effectual difference between continued affectation and
reality.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; [<i>coming up</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp; Scandal, are you
in private discourse?&nbsp; Anything of secrecy?&nbsp; [<i>Aside
to</i> <span class="smcap">Scandal</span>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, but I dare trust you; we were talking of
Angelica&rsquo;s love to Valentine.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t speak
of it.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, no, not a syllable.&nbsp; I know that&rsquo;s
a secret, for it&rsquo;s whispered everywhere.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; What is, Mr. Tattle?&nbsp; I heard you say
something was whispered everywhere.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Your love of Valentine.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; How!</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, madam, his love for your ladyship.&nbsp; Gad
take me, I beg your pardon,&mdash;for I never heard a word of
your ladyship&rsquo;s passion till this instant.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; My passion!&nbsp; And who told you of my passion,
pray sir?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Why, is the devil in you?&nbsp; Did not I tell it
you for a secret?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Gadso; but I thought she might have been trusted
with her own affairs.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Is that your discretion?&nbsp; Trust a woman with
herself?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; You say true, I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
bring all off.&nbsp; It was impossible, madam, for me to imagine
that a person of your ladyship&rsquo;s wit and gallantry could
have so long received the passionate addresses of the
accomplished Valentine, and yet remain insensible; therefore you
will pardon me, if, from a just weight of his merit, with your
ladyship&rsquo;s good judgment, I formed the balance of a
reciprocal affection.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; O the devil, what damned costive poet has given
thee this lesson of fustian to get by rote?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I dare swear you wrong him, it is his own.&nbsp;
And Mr. Tattle only judges of the success of others, from the
effects of his own merit.&nbsp; For certainly Mr. Tattle was
never denied anything in his life.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp; Yes, indeed, madam, several
times.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I swear I don&rsquo;t think &rsquo;tis
possible.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Yes, I vow and swear I have; Lord, madam,
I&rsquo;m the most unfortunate man in the world, and the most
cruelly used by the ladies.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Nay, now you&rsquo;re ungrateful.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, I hope not, &rsquo;tis as much ingratitude to
own some favours as to conceal others.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; There, now it&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand you now.&nbsp; I thought
you had never asked anything but what a lady might modestly
grant, and you confess.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; So faith, your business is done here; now you may
go brag somewhere else.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Brag!&nbsp; O heavens!&nbsp; Why, did I name
anybody?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; No; I suppose that is not in your power; but you
would if you could, no doubt on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Not in my power, madam!&nbsp; What, does your
ladyship mean that I have no woman&rsquo;s reputation in my
power?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; &rsquo;Oons, why, you won&rsquo;t own it, will
you?&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Faith, madam, you&rsquo;re in the right; no more I
have, as I hope to be saved; I never had it in my power to say
anything to a lady&rsquo;s prejudice in my life.&nbsp; For as I
was telling you, madam, I have been the most unsuccessful
creature living, in things of that nature; and never had the good
fortune to be trusted once with a lady&rsquo;s secret, not
once.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; No?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Not once, I dare answer for him.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll answer for him; for I&rsquo;m sure
if he had, he would have told me; I find, madam, you don&rsquo;t
know Mr. Tattle.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No indeed, madam, you don&rsquo;t know me at all,
I find.&nbsp; For sure my intimate friends would have
known&mdash;</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Then it seems you would have told, if you had been
trusted.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O pox, Scandal, that was too far put.&nbsp; Never
have told particulars, madam.&nbsp; Perhaps I might have talked
as of a third person; or have introduced an amour of my own, in
conversation, by way of novel; but never have explained
particulars.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; But whence comes the reputation of Mr.
Tattle&rsquo;s secrecy, if he was never trusted?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Why, thence it arises&mdash;the thing is
proverbially spoken; but may be applied to him&mdash;as if we
should say in general terms, he only is secret who never was
trusted; a satirical proverb upon our sex.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
another upon yours&mdash;as she is chaste, who was never asked
the question.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; A couple of very civil proverbs, truly.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis hard to tell whether the lady or Mr. Tattle be the
more obliged to you.&nbsp; For you found her virtue upon the
backwardness of the men; and his secrecy upon the mistrust of the
women.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Gad, it&rsquo;s very true, madam, I think we are
obliged to acquit ourselves.&nbsp; And for my part&mdash;but your
ladyship is to speak first.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Am I?&nbsp; Well, I freely confess I have resisted
a great deal of temptation.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; And i&rsquo;Gad, I have given some temptation that
has not been resisted.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Good.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I cite Valentine here, to declare to the court, how
fruitless he has found his endeavours, and to confess all his
solicitations and my denials.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I am ready to plead not guilty for you; and guilty
for myself.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; So, why this is fair, here&rsquo;s demonstration
with a witness.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Well, my witnesses are not present.&nbsp; But I
confess I have had favours from persons.&nbsp; But as the favours
are numberless, so the persons are nameless.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Pooh, this proves nothing.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I can show letters, lockets, pictures,
and rings; and if there be occasion for witnesses, I can summon
the maids at the chocolate-houses, all the porters at Pall Mall
and Covent Garden, the door-keepers at the Playhouse, the drawers
at Locket&rsquo;s, Pontack&rsquo;s, the Rummer, Spring Garden, my
own landlady and <i>valet de chambre</i>; all who shall make oath
that I receive more letters than the Secretary&rsquo;s office,
and that I have more vizor-masks to enquire for me, than ever
went to see the Hermaphrodite, or the Naked Prince.&nbsp; And it
is notorious that in a country church once, an enquiry being made
who I was, it was answered, I was the famous Tattle, who had
ruined so many women.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; It was there, I suppose, you got the nickname of
the Great Turk.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; True; I was called Turk-Tattle all over the
parish.&nbsp; The next Sunday all the old women kept their
daughters at home, and the parson had not half his
congregation.&nbsp; He would have brought me into the spiritual
court, but I was revenged upon him, for he had a handsome
daughter whom I initiated into the science.&nbsp; But I repented
it afterwards, for it was talked of in town.&nbsp; And a lady of
quality that shall be nameless, in a raging fit of jealousy, came
down in her coach and six horses, and exposed herself upon my
account; Gad, I was sorry for it with all my heart.&nbsp; You
know whom I mean&mdash;you know where we raffled&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Mum, Tattle.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; &rsquo;Sdeath, are not you ashamed?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; O barbarous!&nbsp; I never heard so insolent a
piece of vanity.&nbsp; Fie, Mr. Tattle; I&rsquo;ll swear I could
not have believed it.&nbsp; Is this your secrecy?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Gadso, the heat of my story carried me beyond my
discretion, as the heat of the lady&rsquo;s passion hurried her
beyond her reputation.&nbsp; But I hope you don&rsquo;t know whom
I mean; for there was a great many ladies raffled.&nbsp; Pox
on&rsquo;t, now could I bite off my tongue.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t; for then you&rsquo;ll tell us no
more.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;ll recommend a song to you upon the
hint of my two proverbs, and I see one in the next room that will
sing it.&nbsp; [<i>Goes to the door</i>.]</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, if you do guess, say
nothing; Gad, I&rsquo;m very unfortunate.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Pray sing the first song in the last new play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SONG.<br />
Set by Mr. John Eccles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p class="poetry">A nymph and a swain to Apollo once prayed,<br
/>
The swain had been jilted, the nymph been betrayed:<br />
Their intent was to try if his oracle knew<br />
E&rsquo;er a nymph that was chaste, or a swain that was true.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p class="poetry">Apollo was mute, and had like t&rsquo;have been

And the nymph may be chaste that has never been tried.</p>

There&rsquo;s an unnatural whelp!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an

therefore, if I were obliged to make a choice, I declare
I&rsquo;d rather have you than your son.</p>

and I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so; I was afraid you were in

my heart.&nbsp; Hang him, mongrel, cast him off; you shall see
the rogue show himself, and make love to some desponding Cadua of

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Dick&mdash;body o&rsquo; me&mdash;Dick has

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; No; I intend you shall marry, Ben; I would not

there&rsquo;s one for t&rsquo;other, an&rsquo; that be all.&nbsp;
Pray don&rsquo;t let me be your hindrance&mdash;e&rsquo;en marry
a God&rsquo;s name, an the wind sit that way.&nbsp; As for my

<p>FRAIL.&nbsp; That would be pity&mdash;such a handsome young
gentleman.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Handsome! he, he, he! nay, forsooth, an you be for
joking, I&rsquo;ll joke with you, for I love my jest, an&rsquo;
the ship were sinking, as we sayn at sea.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
tell you why I don&rsquo;t much stand towards matrimony.&nbsp; I
love to roam about from port to port, and from land to land; I
could never abide to be port-bound, as we call it.&nbsp; Now, a
man that is married has, as it were, d&rsquo;ye see, his feet in
the bilboes, and mayhap mayn&rsquo;t get them out again when he
would.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Ben&rsquo;s a wag.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; A man that is married, d&rsquo;ye see, is no more
like another man than a galley-slave is like one of us free
sailors; he is chained to an oar all his life, and mayhap forced
to tug a leaky vessel into the bargain.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; A very wag&mdash;Ben&rsquo;s a very wag; only
a little rough, he wants a little polishing.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Not at all; I like his humour mightily:
it&rsquo;s plain and honest&mdash;I should like such a humour in
a husband extremely.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Say&rsquo;n you so, forsooth?&nbsp; Marry, and I
should like such a handsome gentlewoman for a bed-fellow
hugely.&nbsp; How say you, mistress, would you like going to
sea?&nbsp; Mess, you&rsquo;re a tight vessel, an well rigged, an
you were but as well manned.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; I should not doubt that if you were master
of me.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, an you come to
sea in a high wind, or that lady&mdash;you may&rsquo;nt carry so
much sail o&rsquo; your head&mdash;top and top gallant, by the
mess.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No, why so?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Why, an you do, you may run the risk to be overset,
and then you&rsquo;ll carry your keels above water, he, he,
he!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I swear, Mr. Benjamin is the veriest wag in
nature&mdash;an absolute sea-wit.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Nay, Ben has parts, but as I told you before,
they want a little polishing.&nbsp; You must not take anything
ill, madam.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; No, I hope the gentlewoman is not angry; I mean all
in good part, for if I give a jest, I&rsquo;ll take a jest, and
so forsooth you may be as free with me.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I thank you, sir, I am not at all offended.&nbsp;
But methinks, Sir Sampson, you should leave him alone with his
mistress.&nbsp; Mr. Tattle, we must not hinder lovers.</p>

you stand a stern a that&rsquo;n, we shall never grapple

please to sit, I&rsquo;ll sit by you.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; You need not sit so near one, if you have anything

<p>BEN.&nbsp; Why that&rsquo;s true, as you say, nor I an&rsquo;t
dumb, I can be heard as far as another,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll heave
off, to please you.&nbsp; [<i>Sits farther off</i>.]&nbsp; An we
were a league asunder, I&rsquo;d undertake to hold discourse with
you, an &rsquo;twere not a main high wind indeed, and full in my
teeth.&nbsp; Look you, forsooth, I am, as it were, bound for the
land of matrimony; &rsquo;tis a voyage, d&rsquo;ye see, that was
none of my seeking.&nbsp; I was commanded by father, and if you
like of it, mayhap I may steer into your harbour.&nbsp; How say
you, mistress?&nbsp; The short of the thing is, that if you like
me, and I like you, we may chance to swing in a hammock
together.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what to say to you, nor I
don&rsquo;t care to speak with you at all.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&nbsp; But pray
why are you so scornful?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; As long as one must not speak one&rsquo;s mind,
one had better not speak at all, I think, and truly I won&rsquo;t
tell a lie for the matter.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Nay, you say true in that, it&rsquo;s but a folly
to lie: for to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary
way is, as it were, to look one way, and to row another.&nbsp;
Now, for my part, d&rsquo;ye see, I&rsquo;m for carrying things
above board, I&rsquo;m not for keeping anything under
hatches,&mdash;so that if you ben&rsquo;t as willing as I, say so
a God&rsquo;s name: there&rsquo;s no harm done; mayhap you may be
shame-faced; some maidens thof they love a man well enough, yet
they don&rsquo;t care to tell&rsquo;n so to&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
If that&rsquo;s the case, why, silence gives consent.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m sure it is not so, for I&rsquo;ll
speak sooner than you should believe that; and I&rsquo;ll speak
truth, though one should always tell a lie to a man; and I
don&rsquo;t care, let my father do what he will; I&rsquo;m too
big to be whipt, so I&rsquo;ll tell you plainly, I don&rsquo;t
like you, nor love you at all, nor never will, that&rsquo;s more:
so there&rsquo;s your answer for you; and don&rsquo;t trouble me
no more, you ugly thing.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Look you, young woman, you may learn to give good
words, however.&nbsp; I spoke you fair, d&rsquo;ye see, and
civil.&nbsp; As for your love or your liking, I don&rsquo;t value
it of a rope&rsquo;s end; and mayhap I like you as little as you
do me: what I said was in obedience to father.&nbsp; Gad, I fear
a whipping no more than you do.&nbsp; But I tell you one thing,
if you should give such language at sea, you&rsquo;d have a cat
o&rsquo; nine tails laid cross your shoulders.&nbsp; Flesh! who
are you?&nbsp; You heard t&rsquo;other handsome young woman speak
civilly to me of her own accord.&nbsp; Whatever you think of
yourself, gad, I don&rsquo;t think you are any more to compare to
her than a can of small-beer to a bowl of punch.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Well, and there&rsquo;s a handsome gentleman, and
a fine gentleman, and a sweet gentleman, that was here that loves
me, and I love him; and if he sees you speak to me any more,
he&rsquo;ll thrash your jacket for you, he will, you great
sea-calf.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; What, do you mean that fair-weather spark that was
here just now?&nbsp; Will he thrash my jacket?&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;n,&mdash;let&rsquo;n.&nbsp; But an he comes near me,
mayhap I may giv&rsquo;n a salt eel for&rsquo;s supper, for all
that.&nbsp; What does father mean to leave me alone as soon as I
come home with such a dirty dowdy?&nbsp; Sea-calf?&nbsp; I
an&rsquo;t calf enough to lick your chalked face, you cheese-curd
you:&mdash;marry thee?&nbsp; Oons, I&rsquo;ll marry a Lapland
witch as soon, and live upon selling contrary winds and wrecked
vessels.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be called names, nor I won&rsquo;t
be abused thus, so I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If I were a man

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, I don&rsquo;t know any

Valentine.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone to bed upon&rsquo;t, and very

defer signing the conveyance.&nbsp; I warrant the devil will tell

I&rsquo;ll bring him a parson to tell him that the devil&rsquo;s
a liar:&mdash;or if that won&rsquo;t do, I&rsquo;ll bring a

<p>SCAN.&nbsp; You say true, man will err; mere man will
err&mdash;but you are something more.&nbsp; There have been wise
men; but they were such as you, men who consulted the stars, and
were observers of omens.&nbsp; Solomon was wise, but
how?&mdash;by his judgment in astrology.&nbsp; So says Pineda in
his third book and eighth chapter&mdash;</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; You are learned, Mr. Scandal.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; A trifler&mdash;but a lover of art.&nbsp; And the
Wise Men of the East owed their instruction to a star, which is
rightly observed by Gregory the Great in favour of
astrology.&nbsp; And Albertus Magnus makes it the most valuable
science, because, says he, it teaches us to consider the
causation of causes, in the causes of things.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I protest I honour you, Mr. Scandal.&nbsp; I did
not think you had been read in these matters.&nbsp; Few young men
are inclined&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I thank my stars that have inclined me.&nbsp; But
I fear this marriage and making over this estate, this
transferring of a rightful inheritance, will bring judgments upon
us.&nbsp; I prophesy it, and I would not have the fate of
Cassandra not to be believed.&nbsp; Valentine is disturbed; what
can be the cause of that?&nbsp; And Sir Sampson is hurried on by
an unusual violence.&nbsp; I fear he does not act wholly from
himself; methinks he does not look as he used to do.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; He was always of an impetuous nature.&nbsp; But as
to this marriage, I have consulted the stars, and all appearances
are prosperous&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Come, come, Mr. Foresight, let not the prospect of
worldly lucre carry you beyond your judgment, nor against your
conscience.&nbsp; You are not satisfied that you act justly.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; You are not satisfied, I say.&nbsp; I am loth to
discourage you, but it is palpable that you are not
satisfied.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How does it appear, Mr. Scandal?&nbsp; I think I
am very well satisfied.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Either you suffer yourself to deceive yourself, or
you do not know yourself.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Pray explain yourself.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Do you sleep well o&rsquo; nights?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Very well.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Are you certain?&nbsp; You do not look so.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I am in health, I think.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; So was Valentine this morning; and looked just
so.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Am I altered any way?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t perceive it.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; That may be, but your beard is longer than it was
two hours ago.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Indeed!&nbsp; Bless me!</p>

<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Husband, will you go to bed?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
ten a&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, your servant.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Pox on her, she has interrupted my
design&mdash;but I must work her into the project.&nbsp; You keep
early hours, madam.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Mr. Foresight is punctual; we sit up after
him.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; My dear, pray lend me your glass, your little
looking-glass.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Pray lend it him, madam.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
the reason.</p>
<p>[<i>She gives him the glass</i>: <span

passion for you is grown so violent, that I am no longer master
of myself.&nbsp; I was interrupted in the morning, when you had
charity enough to give me your attention, and I had hopes of
finding another opportunity of explaining myself to you, but was
disappointed all this day; and the uneasiness that has attended
me ever since brings me now hither at this unseasonable hour.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Was there ever such impudence, to make love
to me before my husband&rsquo;s face?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll swear
I&rsquo;ll tell him.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll die a martyr rather than
disclaim my passion.&nbsp; But come a little farther this way,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you what project I had to get him out of the
way; that I might have an opportunity of waiting upon you.&nbsp;
[<i>Whisper</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Foresight</span>
<i>looking in the glass</i>.]</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I do not see any revolution here; methinks I look
with a serene and benign aspect&mdash;pale, a little
pale&mdash;but the roses of these cheeks have been gathered many
years;&mdash;ha!&nbsp; I do not like that sudden flushing.&nbsp;
Gone already! hem, hem, hem! faintish.&nbsp; My heart is pretty
good; yet it beats; and my pulses, ha!&mdash;I have
none&mdash;mercy on me&mdash;hum.&nbsp; Yes, here they
are&mdash;gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop,
hey!&nbsp; Whither will they hurry me?&nbsp; Now they&rsquo;re
gone again.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;m faint again, and pale again,
and hem! and my hem! breath, hem! grows short; hem! hem! he, he,
hem!</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; It takes: pursue it in the name of love and
pleasure.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; How do you do, Mr. Foresight!</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Hum, not so well as I thought I was.&nbsp; Lend me
your hand.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Look you there now.&nbsp; Your lady says your
sleep has been unquiet of late.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Very likely.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh, mighty restless, but I was afraid to tell
him so.&nbsp; He has been subject to talking and starting.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; And did not use to be so?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Never, never, till within these three nights;
I cannot say that he has once broken my rest since we have been
married.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I will go to bed.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Do so, Mr. Foresight, and say your prayers.&nbsp;
He looks better than he did.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Nurse, nurse!</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Do you think so, Mr. Scandal?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; I hope this will be gone by
morning, taking it in time.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I hope so.</p>

<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Nurse; your master is not well; put him to
bed.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I hope you will be able to see Valentine in the
morning.&nbsp; You had best take a little diacodion and
cowslip-water, and lie upon your back: maybe you may dream.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I thank you, Mr. Scandal, I will.&nbsp; Nurse, let
me have a watch-light, and lay the Crumbs of Comfort by me.</p>
<p>NURSE.&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; And&mdash;hem, hem!&nbsp; I am very faint.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, no, you look much better.</p>

see&mdash;within a quarter of twelve, hem&mdash;he,
hem!&mdash;just upon the turning of the tide, bring me the
urinal; and I hope, neither the lord of my ascendant, nor the
moon will be combust; and then I may do well.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp; Leave that to me; I will erect a
scheme; and I hope I shall find both Sol and Venus in the sixth
house.</p>

great comfort to me.&nbsp; Hem, hem! good night.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Scandal</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Foresight</span>.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Good night, good Mr. Foresight; and I hope Mars
and Venus will be in conjunction;&mdash;while your wife and I are
together.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Well; and what use do you hope to make of
this project?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think that you are ever like
to succeed in your design upon me?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, faith I do; I have a better opinion both of
you and myself than to despair.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Did you ever hear such a toad?&nbsp;
Hark&rsquo;ee, devil: do you think any woman honest?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, several, very honest; they&rsquo;ll cheat a
little at cards, sometimes, but that&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Pshaw! but virtuous, I mean?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, faith, I believe some women are virtuous too;
but &rsquo;tis as I believe some men are valiant, through
fear.&nbsp; For why should a man court danger or a woman shun
pleasure?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh, monstrous!&nbsp; What are conscience and
honour?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Why, honour is a public enemy, and conscience a
domestic thief; and he that would secure his pleasure must pay a
tribute to one and go halves with t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; As for
honour, that you have secured, for you have purchased a perpetual
opportunity for pleasure.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; An opportunity for pleasure?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Ay, your husband, a husband is an opportunity for
pleasure: so you have taken care of honour, and &rsquo;tis the
least I can do to take care of conscience.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; And so you think we are free for one
another?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Yes, faith I think so; I love to speak my
mind.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Why, then, I&rsquo;ll speak my mind.&nbsp;
Now as to this affair between you and me.&nbsp; Here you make
love to me; why, I&rsquo;ll confess it does not displease
me.&nbsp; Your person is well enough, and your understanding is
not amiss.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I have no great opinion of myself, but I think
I&rsquo;m neither deformed nor a fool.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; But you have a villainous character: you are
a libertine in speech, as well as practice.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Come, I know what you would say: you think it more
dangerous to be seen in conversation with me than to allow some
other men the last favour; you mistake: the liberty I take in
talking is purely affected for the service of your sex.&nbsp; He
that first cries out stop thief is often he that has stol&rsquo;n
the treasure.&nbsp; I am a juggler, that act by confederacy; and
if you please, we&rsquo;ll put a trick upon the world.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Ay; but you are such an universal juggler,
that I&rsquo;m afraid you have a great many confederates.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Faith, I&rsquo;m sound.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh, fie&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear you&rsquo;re
impudent.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll swear you&rsquo;re handsome.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Pish, you&rsquo;d tell me so, though you did
not think so.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;d think so, though I should not tell
you so.&nbsp; And now I think we know one another pretty
well.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; O Lord, who&rsquo;s here?</p>

<p>BEN.&nbsp; Mess, I love to speak my mind.&nbsp; Father has
nothing to do with me.&nbsp; Nay, I can&rsquo;t say that neither;
he has something to do with me.&nbsp; But what does that
signify?&nbsp; If so be that I ben&rsquo;t minded to be steered
by him; &rsquo;tis as thof he should strive against wind and
tide.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Ay, but, my dear, we must keep it secret
till the estate be settled; for you know, marrying without an
estate is like sailing in a ship without ballast.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; He, he, he; why, that&rsquo;s true; just so for all
the world it is indeed, as like as two cable ropes.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; And though I have a good portion, you know
one would not venture all in one bottom.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s true again; for mayhap one bottom
may spring a leak.&nbsp; You have hit it indeed: mess,
you&rsquo;ve nicked the channel.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Well, but if you should forsake me after
all, you&rsquo;d break my heart.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Break your heart?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather the
<i>Mary-gold</i> should break her cable in a storm, as well as I
love her.&nbsp; Flesh, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
false-hearted, like a landman.&nbsp; A sailor will be honest,
thof mayhap he has never a penny of money in his pocket.&nbsp;
Mayhap I may not have so fair a face as a citizen or a courtier;
but, for all that, I&rsquo;ve as good blood in my veins, and a
heart as sound as a biscuit.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; And will you love me always?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Nay, an I love once, I&rsquo;ll stick like pitch;
I&rsquo;ll tell you that.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;ll sing you a song
of a sailor.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Hold, there&rsquo;s my sister, I&rsquo;ll
call her to hear it.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Well; I won&rsquo;t go to bed to my husband
to-night, because I&rsquo;ll retire to my own chamber, and think
of what you have said.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well; you&rsquo;ll give me leave to wait upon you
to your chamber door, and leave you my last instructions?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Hold, here&rsquo;s my sister coming towards
us.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; If it won&rsquo;t interrupt you I&rsquo;ll
entertain you with a song.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; The song was made upon one of our
ship&rsquo;s-crew&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Our boatswain made the
song.&nbsp; Mayhap you may know her, sir.&nbsp; Before she was
married she was called buxom Joan of Deptford.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I have heard of her.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; [<i>Sings</i>]:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">BALLAD.<br />
Set by <span class="smcap">Mr. John Eccles</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p class="poetry">A soldier and a sailor,<br />
A tinker and a tailor,<br />
Had once a doubtful strife, sir,<br />
To make a maid a wife, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose name was buxom Joan.<br />
For now the time was ended,<br />
When she no more intended<br />
To lick her lips at men, sir,<br />
And gnaw the sheets in vain, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lie o&rsquo; nights alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p class="poetry">The soldier swore like thunder,<br />
He loved her more than plunder,<br />
And shewed her many a scar, sir,<br />
That he had brought from far, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fighting for her sake.<br />
The tailor thought to please her<br />
With offering her his measure.<br />
The tinker, too, with mettle<br />
Said he could mend her kettle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stop up ev&rsquo;ry leak.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">III.</p>
<p class="poetry">But while these three were prating,<br />
The sailor slyly waiting,<br />
Thought if it came about, sir,<br />
That they should all fall out, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He then might play his part.<br />
And just e&rsquo;en as he meant, sir,<br />
To loggerheads they went, sir,<br />
And then he let fly at her<br />
A shot &rsquo;twixt wind and water,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That won this fair maid&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; If some of our crew that came to see me are not
gone, you shall see that we sailors can dance sometimes as well
as other folks.&nbsp; [<i>Whistles</i>.]&nbsp; I warrant that
brings &rsquo;em, an they be within hearing.&nbsp; [<i>Enter
seamen</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, here they be&mdash;and fiddles along
with &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Come, my lads, let&rsquo;s have a round,
and I&rsquo;ll make one.&nbsp; [<i>Dance</i>.]</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re merry folks, we sailors: we han&rsquo;t
much to care for.&nbsp; Thus we live at sea; eat biscuit, and
drink flip, put on a clean shirt once a quarter; come home and
lie with our landladies once a year, get rid of a little money,
and then put off with the next fair wind.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye
like us?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Oh, you are the happiest, merriest men
alive.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re beholden to Mr. Benjamin for this
entertainment.&nbsp; I believe it&rsquo;s late.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Why, forsooth, an you think so, you had best go to
bed.&nbsp; For my part, I mean to toss a can, and remember my
sweet-heart, afore I turn in; mayhap I may dream of her.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, you had best go to bed and dream
too.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Why, faith, I have a good lively imagination, and
can dream as much to the purpose as another, if I set about
it.&nbsp; But dreaming is the poor retreat of a lazy, hopeless,
and imperfect lover; &rsquo;tis the last glimpse of love to
worn-out sinners, and the faint dawning of a bliss to wishing
girls and growing boys.</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s nought but willing, waking love,
that can<br />
Make blest the ripened maid and finished man.</p>

<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well, is your master ready? does he look madly and
talk madly?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Yes, sir; you need make no great doubt of
that.&nbsp; He that was so near turning poet yesterday morning
can&rsquo;t be much to seek in playing the madman to-day.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Would he have Angelica acquainted with the reason
of his design?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; No, sir, not yet.&nbsp; He has a mind to try
whether his playing the madman won&rsquo;t make her play the
fool, and fall in love with him; or at least own that she has
loved him all this while and concealed it.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I saw her take coach just now with her maid, and
think I heard her bid the coachman drive hither.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Like enough, sir, for I told her maid this
morning, my master was run stark mad only for love of her
mistress.&mdash;I hear a coach stop; if it should be she, sir, I
believe he would not see her, till he hears how she takes it.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll try her:&mdash;&rsquo;tis
she&mdash;here she comes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Angelica</span> <i>with</i> <span
class="smcap">Jenny</span>.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, I suppose you don&rsquo;t think it a
novelty to see a woman visit a man at his own lodgings in a
morning?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Not upon a kind occasion, madam.&nbsp; But when a
lady comes tyrannically to insult a ruined lover, and make
manifest the cruel triumphs of her beauty, the barbarity of it
something surprises me.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like raillery from a serious
face.&nbsp; Pray tell me what is the matter?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; No strange matter, madam; my master&rsquo;s mad,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I suppose your ladyship has thought him
so a great while.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye mean, mad?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Why, faith, madam, he&rsquo;s mad for want of his
wits, just as he was poor for want of money; his head is
e&rsquo;en as light as his pockets, and anybody that has a mind
to a bad bargain can&rsquo;t do better than to beg him for his
estate.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; If you speak truth, your endeavouring at wit is
very unseasonable.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s concerned, and loves him.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, you can&rsquo;t think me guilty of so
much inhumanity as not to be concerned for a man I must own
myself obliged to?&nbsp; Pray tell me truth.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Faith, madam, I wish telling a lie would mend the
matter.&nbsp; But this is no new effect of an unsuccessful
passion.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; I know not what to
think.&nbsp; Yet I should be vexed to have a trick put upon
me.&nbsp; May I not see him?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid the physician is not willing you
should see him yet.&nbsp; Jeremy, go in and enquire.</p>
<h3>SCENE III.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Scandal</span>,
<span class="smcap">Angelica</span>, <span
class="smcap">Jenny</span>.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I saw him wink and smile.&nbsp; I fancy
&rsquo;tis a trick&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try.&mdash;I would disguise
to all the world a failing which I must own to you: I fear my
happiness depends upon the recovery of Valentine.&nbsp; Therefore
I conjure you, as you are his friend, and as you have compassion
upon one fearful of affliction, to tell me what I am to hope
for&mdash;I cannot speak&mdash;but you may tell me, tell me, for
you know what I would ask?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; So, this is pretty plain.&nbsp; Be not too much
concerned, madam; I hope his condition is not desperate.&nbsp; An
acknowledgment of love from you, perhaps, may work a cure, as the
fear of your aversion occasioned his distemper.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Say you so; nay, then,
I&rsquo;m convinced.&nbsp; And if I don&rsquo;t play trick for
trick, may I never taste the pleasure of
revenge.&mdash;Acknowledgment of love!&nbsp; I find you have
mistaken my compassion, and think me guilty of a weakness I am a
stranger to.&nbsp; But I have too much sincerity to deceive you,
and too much charity to suffer him to be deluded with vain
hopes.&nbsp; Good nature and humanity oblige me to be concerned
for him; but to love is neither in my power nor inclination, and
if he can&rsquo;t be cured without I suck the poison from his
wounds, I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t recover his senses till I
lose mine.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Hey, brave woman, i&rsquo;faith&mdash;won&rsquo;t
you see him, then, if he desire it?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; What signify a madman&rsquo;s desires?&nbsp;
Besides, &rsquo;twould make me uneasy:&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t see
him, perhaps my concern for him may lessen.&nbsp; If I forget
him, &rsquo;tis no more than he has done by himself; and now the
surprise is over, methinks I am not half so sorry as I was.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; So, faith, good nature works apace; you were
confessing just now an obligation to his love.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; But I have considered that passions are
unreasonable and involuntary; if he loves, he can&rsquo;t help
it; and if I don&rsquo;t love, I can&rsquo;t help it; no more
than he can help his being a man, or I my being a woman: or no
more than I can help my want of inclination to stay longer
here.&nbsp; Come, Jenny.</p>

<p>JERE.&nbsp; What, is she gone, sir?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Gone?&nbsp; Why, she was never here, nor anywhere
else; nor I don&rsquo;t know her if I see her, nor you
neither.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Good lack!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter
now?&nbsp; Are any more of us to be mad?&nbsp; Why, sir, my
master longs to see her, and is almost mad in good earnest with
the joyful news of her being here.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; We are all under a mistake.&nbsp; Ask no
questions, for I can&rsquo;t resolve you; but I&rsquo;ll inform
your master.&nbsp; In the meantime, if our project succeed no
better with his father than it does with his mistress, he may
descend from his exaltation of madness into the road of common
sense, and be content only to be made a fool with other
reasonable people.&nbsp; I hear Sir Sampson.&nbsp; You know your

matter is with him, or I&rsquo;ll crack your fool&rsquo;s

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; How now, what&rsquo;s here to do?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s that?&nbsp;
[<i>Starting</i>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; For heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sake softly, sir, and
gently; don&rsquo;t provoke him.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Answer me: who is that, and that?</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Gads bobs, does he not know me?&nbsp; Is he
mischievous?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak gently.&nbsp; Val, Val, dost
thou not know me, boy?&nbsp; Not know thy own father, Val?&nbsp;
I am thy own father, and this is honest Brief Buckram, the
lawyer.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; It may be so&mdash;I did not know you&mdash;the
world is full.&nbsp; There are people that we do know, and people
that we do not know, and yet the sun shines upon all alike.&nbsp;
There are fathers that have many children, and there are children
that have many fathers.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis strange!&nbsp; But I am
Truth, and come to give the world the lie.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, I know not what to say to
him.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Why does that lawyer wear black?&nbsp; Does he
carry his conscience withoutside?&nbsp; Lawyer what art
thou?&nbsp; Dost thou know me?</p>
<p>BUCK.&nbsp; O Lord, what must I say?&nbsp; Yes, sir,</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Thou liest, for I am Truth.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis hard I
cannot get a livelihood amongst you.&nbsp; I have been sworn out
of Westminster Hall the first day of every term&mdash;let me
see&mdash;no matter how long.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you one
thing: it&rsquo;s a question that would puzzle an arithmetician,
if you should ask him, whether the Bible saves more souls in
Westminster Abbey, or damns more in Westminster Hall.&nbsp; For
my part, I am Truth, and can&rsquo;t tell; I have very few
acquaintance.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, he talks sensibly in his
madness.&nbsp; Has he no intervals?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Very short, sir.</p>
<p>BUCK.&nbsp; Sir, I can do you no service while he&rsquo;s in
this condition.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s your paper, sir&mdash;he may
do me a mischief if I stay.&nbsp; The conveyance is ready, sir,
if he recover his senses.</p>

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Hold, hold, don&rsquo;t you go yet.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better let him go, sir, and send for
him if there be occasion; for I fancy his presence provokes him
more.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Is the lawyer gone?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well, then we
may drink about without going together by the ears&mdash;heigh

<p>VAL.&nbsp; Pray let me see it, sir.&nbsp; You hold it so far
off that I can&rsquo;t tell whether I know it or no.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; See it, boy?&nbsp; Ay, ay; why, thou dost see
it&mdash;&rsquo;tis thy own hand, Vally.&nbsp; Why, let me see, I
can read it as plain as can be.&nbsp; Look you here.&nbsp;

<p>VAL.&nbsp; Will you please to let me hold it, sir?</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Let thee hold it, sayest thou?&nbsp; Ay, with
all my heart.&nbsp; What matter is it who holds it?&nbsp; What
need anybody hold it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put it up in my pocket,
Val, and then nobody need hold it.&nbsp; [<i>Puts the paper in

boy.&nbsp; But thou shalt have it as soon as thou hast set thy

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Oons!&nbsp; What a vexation is here!&nbsp; I
know not what to do, or say, nor which way to go.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s out of his way?&nbsp;
I am Truth, and can set him right.&nbsp; Harkee, friend, the
straight road is the worst way you can go.&nbsp; He that follows
his nose always, will very often be led into a stink.&nbsp;
<i>Probatum est</i>.&nbsp; But what are you for? religion or
politics?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a couple of topics for you, no more
like one another than oil and vinegar; and yet those two, beaten
together by a state-cook, make sauce for the whole nation.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; What the devil had I to do, ever to beget
sons?&nbsp; Why did I ever marry?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Because thou wert a monster, old boy!&nbsp; The two
greatest monsters in the world are a man and a woman!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s thy opinion?</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Why, my opinion is, that those two monsters
joined together, make yet a greater, that&rsquo;s a man and his
wife.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; Old True-penny, say&rsquo;st thou
so?&nbsp; Thou hast nicked it.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s wonderful
strange, Jeremy.</p>

<p>FORE.&nbsp; Ah, Sir Sampson, heav&rsquo;n help your
head.&nbsp; This is none of your lucky hour; <i>Nemo omnibus
horis sapit</i>.&nbsp; What, is he gone, and in contempt of
science?&nbsp; Ill stars and unconvertible ignorance attend
him.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; You must excuse his passion, Mr. Foresight, for he
has been heartily vexed.&nbsp; His son is <i>non compos

law; so that all his measures are disappointed.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Ha! say you so?</p>

hope, then?&nbsp; [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.

<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Do with him?&nbsp; Send him to sea again in

element, and won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the tide turned.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Wherein was I mistaken, not to foresee this?&nbsp;

<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Madam, you and I can tell him something else that
he did not foresee, and more particularly relating to his own

<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; What do you mean?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
understand you.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Hush, softly,&mdash;the pleasures of last night,
my dear, too considerable to be forgot so soon.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Last night!&nbsp; And what would your
impudence infer from last night?&nbsp; Last night was like the
night before, I think.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; &rsquo;Sdeath, do you make no difference between
me and your husband?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Not much,&mdash;he&rsquo;s superstitious, and
you are mad, in my opinion.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; You make me mad.&nbsp; You are not serious.&nbsp;
Pray recollect yourself.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh yes, now I remember, you were very
impertinent and impudent,&mdash;and would have come to bed to
me.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; And did not?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Did not!&nbsp; With that face can you ask the
question?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; This I have heard of before, but never
believed.&nbsp; I have been told, she had that admirable quality
of forgetting to a man&rsquo;s face in the morning that she had
lain with him all night, and denying that she had done favours
with more impudence than she could grant &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Madam,
I&rsquo;m your humble servant, and honour you.&mdash;You look
pretty well, Mr. Foresight: how did you rest last night?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Truly, Mr. Scandal, I was so taken up with broken
dreams and distracted visions that I remember little.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a very forgetting night.&nbsp; But
would you not talk with Valentine?&nbsp; Perhaps you may
understand him; I&rsquo;m apt to believe there is something
mysterious in his discourses, and sometimes rather think him
inspired than mad.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; You speak with singular good judgment, Mr.
Scandal, truly.&nbsp; I am inclining to your Turkish opinion in
this matter, and do reverence a man whom the vulgar think
mad.&nbsp; Let us go to him.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Sister, do you stay with them; I&rsquo;ll
find out my lover, and give him his discharge, and come to
you.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my conscience, here he comes.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mrs.
Frail</span>, <span class="smcap">Ben</span>.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; All mad, I think.&nbsp; Flesh, I believe all the
calentures of the sea are come ashore, for my part.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Mr. Benjamin in choler!</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;m pleased well enough, now I have found
you.&nbsp; Mess, I have had such a hurricane upon your account
yonder.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; My account; pray what&rsquo;s the
matter?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Why, father came and found me squabbling with yon
chitty-faced thing as he would have me marry, so he asked what
was the matter.&nbsp; He asked in a surly sort of a way&mdash;it
seems brother Val is gone mad, and so that put&rsquo;n into a
passion; but what did I know that? what&rsquo;s that to
me?&mdash;so he asked in a surly sort of manner, and gad I
answered &rsquo;n as surlily.&nbsp; What thof he be my father, I
an&rsquo;t bound prentice to &rsquo;n; so faith I told &rsquo;n
in plain terms, if I were minded to marry, I&rsquo;d marry to
please myself, not him.&nbsp; And for the young woman that he
provided for me, I thought it more fitting for her to learn her
sampler and make dirt-pies than to look after a husband; for my
part I was none of her man.&nbsp; I had another voyage to make,
let him take it as he will.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; So, then, you intend to go to sea again?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Nay, nay, my mind run upon you, but I would not
tell him so much.&nbsp; So he said he&rsquo;d make my heart ache;
and if so be that he could get a woman to his mind, he&rsquo;d
marry himself.&nbsp; Gad, says I, an you play the fool and marry
at these years, there&rsquo;s more danger of your head&rsquo;s
aching than my heart.&nbsp; He was woundy angry when I
gave&rsquo;n that wipe.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t a word to say, and
so I left&rsquo;n, and the green girl together; mayhap the bee
may bite, and he&rsquo;ll marry her himself, with all my
heart.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; And were you this undutiful and graceless
wretch to your father?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Then why was he graceless first?&nbsp; If I am
undutiful and graceless, why did he beget me so?&nbsp; I did not
get myself.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O impiety!&nbsp; How have I been
mistaken!&nbsp; What an inhuman, merciless creature have I set my
heart upon?&nbsp; Oh, I am happy to have discovered the shelves
and quicksands that lurk beneath that faithless, smiling
face.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Hey toss!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp;
Why, you ben&rsquo;t angry, be you?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Oh, see me no more,&mdash;for thou wert born
amongst rocks, suckled by whales, cradled in a tempest, and
whistled to by winds; and thou art come forth with fins and
scales, and three rows of teeth, a most outrageous fish of
prey.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; O Lord, O Lord, she&rsquo;s mad, poor young woman:
love has turned her senses, her brain is quite overset.&nbsp;
Well-a-day, how shall I do to set her to rights?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No, no, I am not mad, monster; I am wise
enough to find you out.&nbsp; Hadst thou the impudence to aspire
at being a husband with that stubborn and disobedient
temper?&nbsp; You that know not how to submit to a father,
presume to have a sufficient stock of duty to undergo a
wife?&nbsp; I should have been finely fobbed indeed, very finely
fobbed.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Harkee, forsooth; if so be that you are in your
right senses, d&rsquo;ye see, for ought as I perceive I&rsquo;m
like to be finely fobbed,&mdash;if I have got anger here upon
your account, and you are tacked about already.&nbsp; What
d&rsquo;ye mean, after all your fair speeches, and stroking my
cheeks, and kissing and hugging, what would you sheer off
so?&nbsp; Would you, and leave me aground?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll leave you adrift, and go
which way you will.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; What, are you false-hearted, then?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Only the wind&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; More shame for you,&mdash;the wind&rsquo;s
changed?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ill wind blows nobody
good,&mdash;mayhap I have a good riddance on you, if these be
your tricks.&nbsp; What, did you mean all this while to make a
fool of me?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Any fool but a husband.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Husband!&nbsp; Gad, I would not be your husband if
you would have me, now I know your mind: thof you had your weight
in gold and jewels, and thof I loved you never so well.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Why, can&rsquo;st thou love, Porpuss?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; No matter what I can do; don&rsquo;t call
names.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t love you so well as to bear that,
whatever I did.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you show yourself,
mistress.&nbsp; Let them marry you as don&rsquo;t know you.&nbsp;
Gad, I know you too well, by sad experience; I believe he that
marries you will go to sea in a hen-pecked frigate&mdash;I
believe that, young woman&mdash;and mayhap may come to an anchor
at Cuckolds-Point; so there&rsquo;s a dash for you, take it as
you will: mayhap you may holla after me when I won&rsquo;t come
to.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha, no doubt on&rsquo;t.&mdash;<i>My
true love is gone to sea</i>.&nbsp; [<i>Sings</i>]</p>
<h3>SCENE XIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mrs.
Frail</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Foresight</span>.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O sister, had you come a minute sooner, you
would have seen the resolution of a lover:&mdash;honest Tar and I
are parted;&mdash;and with the same indifference that we
met.&nbsp; O&rsquo; my life I am half vexed at the insensibility
of a brute that I despised.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; What then, he bore it most heroically?</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Most tyrannically; for you see he has got
the start of me, and I, the poor forsaken maid, am left
complaining on the shore.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you a hint
that he has given me: Sir Sampson is enraged, and talks
desperately of committing matrimony himself.&nbsp; If he has a
mind to throw himself away, he can&rsquo;t do it more effectually
than upon me, if we could bring it about.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Oh, hang him, old fox, he&rsquo;s too
cunning; besides, he hates both you and me.&nbsp; But I have a
project in my head for you, and I have gone a good way towards
it.&nbsp; I have almost made a bargain with Jeremy,
Valentine&rsquo;s man, to sell his master to us.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Sell him?&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Valentine raves upon Angelica, and took me
for her, and Jeremy says will take anybody for her that he
imposes on him.&nbsp; Now, I have promised him mountains, if in
one of his mad fits he will bring you to him in her stead, and
get you married together and put to bed together; and after
consummation, girl, there&rsquo;s no revoking.&nbsp; And if he
should recover his senses, he&rsquo;ll be glad at least to make
you a good settlement.&nbsp; Here they come: stand aside a
little, and tell me how you like the design.</p>

<p>JERE.&nbsp; Yes, sir; he says he&rsquo;ll favour it, and
mistake her for Angelica.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; It may make us sport.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Mercy on us!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Husht&mdash;interrupt me not&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
whisper prediction to thee, and thou shalt prophesy.&nbsp; I am
Truth, and can teach thy tongue a new trick.&nbsp; I have told
thee what&rsquo;s past,&mdash;now I&rsquo;ll tell what&rsquo;s to
come.&nbsp; Dost thou know what will happen
to-morrow?&mdash;Answer me not&mdash;for I will tell thee.&nbsp;
To-morrow, knaves will thrive through craft, and fools through
fortune, and honesty will go as it did, frost-nipt in a summer
suit.&nbsp; Ask me questions concerning to-morrow.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Ask him, Mr. Foresight.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Pray what will be done at court?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Scandal will tell you.&nbsp; I am Truth; I never
come there.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; In the city?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Oh, prayers will be said in empty churches at the
usual hours.&nbsp; Yet you will see such zealous faces behind
counters, as if religion were to be sold in every shop.&nbsp; Oh,
things will go methodically in the city: the clocks will strike
twelve at noon, and the horned herd buzz in the exchange at
two.&nbsp; Wives and husbands will drive distinct trades, and
care and pleasure separately occupy the family.&nbsp;
Coffee-houses will be full of smoke and stratagem.&nbsp; And the
cropt prentice, that sweeps his master&rsquo;s shop in the
morning, may ten to one dirty his sheets before night.&nbsp; But
there are two things that you will see very strange: which are
wanton wives with their legs at liberty, and tame cuckolds with
chains about their necks.&nbsp; But hold, I must examine you
before I go further.&nbsp; You look suspiciously.&nbsp; Are you a
husband?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I am married.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Poor creature!&nbsp; Is your wife of Covent Garden
parish?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; No; St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Alas, poor man; his eyes are sunk, and his hands
shrivelled; his legs dwindled, and his back bowed: pray, pray,
for a metamorphosis.&nbsp; Change thy shape and shake off age;
get thee Medea&rsquo;s kettle and be boiled anew; come forth with
lab&rsquo;ring callous hands, a chine of steel, and Atlas
shoulders.&nbsp; Let Taliacotius trim the calves of twenty
chairmen, and make thee pedestals to stand erect upon, and look
matrimony in the face.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; That a man should
have a stomach to a wedding supper, when the pigeons ought rather
to be laid to his feet, ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; His frenzy is very high now, Mr. Scandal.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I believe it is a spring tide.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Very likely, truly.&nbsp; You understand these
matters.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, I shall be very glad to confer with
you about these things which he has uttered.&nbsp; His sayings
are very mysterious and hieroglyphical.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Oh, why would Angelica be absent from my eyes so
long?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s here, sir.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Now, sister.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; O Lord, what must I say?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Humour him, madam, by all means.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; Oh, I see her&mdash;she comes,
like riches, health, and liberty at once, to a despairing,
starving, and abandoned wretch.&nbsp; Oh, welcome, welcome.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye, sir?&nbsp; Can I serve
you?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Harkee; I have a secret to tell you: Endymion and
the moon shall meet us upon Mount Latmos, and we&rsquo;ll be
married in the dead of night.&nbsp; But say not a word.&nbsp;
Hymen shall put his torch into a dark lanthorn, that it may be
secret; and Juno shall give her peacock poppy-water, that he may
fold his ogling tail, and Argus&rsquo;s hundred eyes be shut,
ha!&nbsp; Nobody shall know but Jeremy.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; No, no, we&rsquo;ll keep it secret, it shall
be done presently.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; The sooner the better.&nbsp; Jeremy, come
hither&mdash;closer&mdash;that none may overhear us.&nbsp;
Jeremy, I can tell you news: Angelica is turned nun, and I am
turning friar, and yet we&rsquo;ll marry one another in spite of
the pope.&nbsp; Get me a cowl and beads, that I may play my
part,&mdash;for she&rsquo;ll meet me two hours hence in black and
white, and a long veil to cover the project, and we won&rsquo;t
see one another&rsquo;s faces, till we have done something to be
ashamed of; and then we&rsquo;ll blush once for all.</p>

<p>JERE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take care, and&mdash;</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Whisper.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Nay, Mr. Tattle, if you make love to me, you spoil
my design, for I intend to make you my confidant.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; But, madam, to throw away your person&mdash;such a
person!&mdash;and such a fortune on a madman!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I never loved him till he was mad; but don&rsquo;t
tell anybody so.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s this!&nbsp; Tattle making love to
Angelica!</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Tell, madam?&nbsp; Alas, you don&rsquo;t know
me.&nbsp; I have much ado to tell your ladyship how long I have
been in love with you&mdash;but encouraged by the impossibility
of Valentine&rsquo;s making any more addresses to you, I have
ventured to declare the very inmost passion of my heart.&nbsp; O
madam, look upon us both.&nbsp; There you see the ruins of a poor
decayed creature&mdash;here, a complete and lively figure, with
youth and health, and all his five senses in perfection, madam,
and to all this, the most passionate lover&mdash;</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; O fie, for shame, hold your tongue.&nbsp; A
passionate lover, and five senses in perfection!&nbsp; When you
are as mad as Valentine, I&rsquo;ll believe you love me, and the
maddest shall take me.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; It is enough.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s here?</p>
<p>FRAIL.&nbsp; O Lord, her coming will spoil all.&nbsp;
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.]</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; No, no, madam, he won&rsquo;t know her; if he
should, I can persuade him.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Scandal, who are these?&nbsp; Foreigners?&nbsp; If
they are, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think,&mdash;get away all
the company but Angelica, that I may discover my design to
her.&nbsp; [<i>Whisper</i>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I will&mdash;I have discovered something of Tattle
that is of a piece with Mrs. Frail.&nbsp; He courts Angelica; if
we could contrive to couple &rsquo;em
together.&mdash;Hark&rsquo;ee&mdash;[<i>Whisper</i>.]</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t know you, cousin; he knows
nobody.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; But he knows more than anybody.&nbsp; O niece, he
knows things past and to come, and all the profound secrets of
time.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Look you, Mr. Foresight, it is not my way to make
many words of matters, and so I shan&rsquo;t say much,&mdash;but
in short, d&rsquo;ye see, I will hold you a hundred pounds now,
that I know more secrets than he.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; I cannot read that knowledge in your
face, Mr. Tattle.&nbsp; Pray, what do you know?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Why, d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;ll tell you,
sir?&nbsp; Read it in my face?&nbsp; No, sir, &rsquo;tis written
in my heart; and safer there, sir, than letters writ in juice of
lemon, for no fire can fetch it out.&nbsp; I am no blab, sir.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Acquaint Jeremy with it, he may easily bring it
about.&nbsp; They are welcome, and I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em so
myself.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>.]&nbsp; What, do you look strange
upon me?&nbsp; Then I must be plain.&nbsp; [<i>Coming up to
them</i>.]&nbsp; I am Truth, and hate an old acquaintance with a
new face.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Scandal</span> <i>goes aside
with</i> <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.]</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Do you know me, Valentine?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; Who are you?&nbsp; No, I hope not.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I am Jack Tattle, your friend.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; My friend, what to do?&nbsp; I am no married man,
and thou canst not lie with my wife.&nbsp; I am very poor, and
thou canst not borrow money of me.&nbsp; Then what employment
have I for a friend?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ha! a good open speaker, and not to be trusted
with a secret.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Do you know me, Valentine?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Oh, very well.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Who am I?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a woman.&nbsp; One to whom
heav&rsquo;n gave beauty, when it grafted roses on a briar.&nbsp;
You are the reflection of heav&rsquo;n in a pond, and he that
leaps at you is sunk.&nbsp; You are all white, a sheet of lovely,
spotless paper, when you first are born; but you are to be
scrawled and blotted by every goose&rsquo;s quill.&nbsp; I know
you; for I loved a woman, and loved her so long, that I found out
a strange thing: I found out what a woman was good for.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay, prithee, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Why, to keep a secret.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; O Lord!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Oh, exceeding good to keep a secret; for though she
should tell, yet she is not to be believed.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Hah! good again, faith.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I would have music.&nbsp; Sing me the song that I
like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SONG<br />
Set by <span class="smcap">Mr. Finger</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">I tell thee, Charmion, could I time
retrieve,<br />
And could again begin to love and live,<br />
To you I should my earliest off&rsquo;ring give;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know my eyes would lead my heart to you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I should all my vows and oaths renew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But to be plain, I never would be true.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p class="poetry">For by our weak and weary truth, I find,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; But for relief of either sex agree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since women love to change, and so do we.</p>
<p>No more, for I am melancholy.&nbsp; [<i>Walks musing</i>.]</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do&rsquo;t, sir.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Mr. Foresight, we had best leave him.&nbsp; He may
grow outrageous, and do mischief.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; I will be directed by you.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Frail</span>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll meet, madam?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
take care everything shall be ready.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; Thou shalt do what thou wilt; in short, I
will deny thee nothing.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Madam, shall I wait upon you?&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Angelica</span>.]</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll stay with him; Mr. Scandal will
protect me.&nbsp; Aunt, Mr. Tattle desires you would give him
leave to wait on you.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Pox on&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s no coming off, now
she has said that.&nbsp; Madam, will you do me the honour?</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Mr. Tattle might have used less ceremony.</p>
<h3>SCENE XVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Angelica</span>, <span
class="smcap">Valentine</span>, <span
class="smcap">Scandal</span>.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Jeremy, follow Tattle.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Mr. Scandal, I only stay till my maid comes, and
because I had a mind to be rid of Mr. Tattle.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Madam, I am very glad that I overheard a better
reason which you gave to Mr. Tattle; for his impertinence forced
you to acknowledge a kindness for Valentine, which you denied to
all his sufferings and my solicitations.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ll
leave him to make use of the discovery, and your ladyship to the
free confession of your inclinations.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; O heav&rsquo;ns!&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t leave me
alone with a madman?</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, madam; I only leave a madman to his
remedy.</p>
<h3>SCENE XVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Angelica</span>, <span
class="smcap">Valentine</span>.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Madam, you need not be very much afraid, for I
fancy I begin to come to myself.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Ay, but if I don&rsquo;t fit you, I&rsquo;ll be
hanged.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You see what disguises love makes us put on.&nbsp;
Gods have been in counterfeited shapes for the same reason; and
the divine part of me, my mind, has worn this mask of madness and
this motley livery, only as the slave of love and menial creature
of your beauty.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Mercy on me, how he talks!&nbsp; Poor
Valentine!</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Nay, faith, now let us understand one another,
hypocrisy apart.&nbsp; The comedy draws toward an end, and let us
think of leaving acting and be ourselves; and since you have
loved me, you must own I have at length deserved you should
confess it.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]&nbsp; I would I had loved
you&mdash;for heav&rsquo;n knows I pity you, and could I have
foreseen the bad effects, I would have striven; but that&rsquo;s
too late.&nbsp; [<i>Sighs</i>.]</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; What sad effects?&mdash;what&rsquo;s too
late?&nbsp; My seeming madness has deceived my father, and
procured me time to think of means to reconcile me to him, and
preserve the right of my inheritance to his estate; which
otherwise, by articles, I must this morning have resigned.&nbsp;
And this I had informed you of to-day, but you were gone before I
knew you had been here.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; I thought your love of me had caused
this transport in your soul; which, it seems, you only
counterfeited, for mercenary ends and sordid interest.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Nay, now you do me wrong; for if any interest was
considered it was yours, since I thought I wanted more than love
to make me worthy of you.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Then you thought me mercenary.&nbsp; But how am I
deluded by this interval of sense to reason with a madman?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;tis barbarous to misunderstand me
longer.</p>
<h3>SCENE XIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Oh, here&rsquo;s a reasonable creature&mdash;sure
he will not have the impudence to persevere.&nbsp; Come, Jeremy,
acknowledge your trick, and confess your master&rsquo;s madness
counterfeit.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Counterfeit, madam!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll maintain him
to be as absolutely and substantially mad as any freeholder in
Bethlehem; nay, he&rsquo;s as mad as any projector, fanatic,
chymist, lover, or poet in Europe.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Sirrah, you be; I am not mad.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha! you see he denies it.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; O Lord, madam, did you ever know any madman mad
enough to own it?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Sot, can&rsquo;t you apprehend?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Why, he talked very sensibly just now.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Yes, madam; he has intervals.&nbsp; But you see he
begins to look wild again now.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Why, you thick-skulled rascal, I tell you the farce
is done, and I will be mad no longer.&nbsp; [<i>Beats
him</i>.]</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha! is he mad or no, Jeremy?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Partly, I think,&mdash;for he does not know his
own mind two hours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I left him just now in
the humour to be mad, and I think I have not found him very quiet
at this present.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s there?&nbsp; [<i>One
knocks</i>.]</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Go see, you sot.&mdash;I&rsquo;m very glad that I
can move your mirth though not your compassion.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I did not think you had apprehension enough to be
exceptions.&nbsp; But madmen show themselves most by
over-pretending to a sound understanding, as drunken men do by
over-acting sobriety.&nbsp; I was half inclining to believe you,
till I accidently touched upon your tender part: but now you have
restored me to my former opinion and compassion.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, your father has sent to know if you are any
better yet.&nbsp; Will you please to be mad, sir, or how?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Stupidity!&nbsp; You know the penalty of all
I&rsquo;m worth must pay for the confession of my senses;
I&rsquo;m mad, and will be mad to everybody but this lady.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; So&mdash;just the very backside of
truth,&mdash;but lying is a figure in speech that interlards the
greatest part of my conversation.&nbsp; Madam, your
ladyship&rsquo;s woman.</p>

<p>JENNY.&nbsp; Yes, madam; Sir Sampson will wait upon you
presently.&nbsp; [<i>Aside to</i> <span
class="smcap">Angelica</span>.]</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You are not leaving me in this uncertainty?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Would anything but a madman complain of
uncertainty?&nbsp; Uncertainty and expectation are the joys of
life.&nbsp; Security is an insipid thing, and the overtaking and
possessing of a wish discovers the folly of the chase.&nbsp;
Never let us know one another better, for the pleasure of a
masquerade is done when we come to show our faces; but I&rsquo;ll
tell you two things before I leave you: I am not the fool you
take me for; and you are mad and don&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>VAL.&nbsp; From a riddle you can expect nothing but a
riddle.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s my instruction and the moral of my
lesson.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; What, is the lady gone again, sir?&nbsp; I hope
you understood one another before she went?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Understood!&nbsp; She is harder to be understood
than a piece of Egyptian antiquity or an Irish manuscript: you
may pore till you spoil your eyes and not improve your
knowledge.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; I have heard &rsquo;em say, sir, they read hard
Hebrew books backwards; maybe you begin to read at the wrong
end.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; They say so of a witch&rsquo;s prayer, and dreams
and Dutch almanacs are to be understood by contraries.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s regularity and method in that; she is a medal
without a reverse or inscription, for indifference has both sides
alike.&nbsp; Yet, while she does not seem to hate me, I will
pursue her, and know her if it be possible, in spite of the
opinion of my satirical friend, Scandal, who says&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">That women are like tricks by sleight of
hand,<br />
Which, to admire, we should not understand.</p>

would be here before me?</p>
<p>JENNY.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s at the great glass in the dining-room,
madam, setting his cravat and wig.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If he
has a mind I should like him, it&rsquo;s a sign he likes me; and
that&rsquo;s more than half my design.</p>
<p>JENNY.&nbsp; I hear him, madam.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Leave me; and, d&rsquo;ye hear, if Valentine should
come, or send, I am not to be spoken with.</p>
<h3>SCENE II.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Angelica</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir
Sampson</span>.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; I have not been honoured with the commands of
a fair lady a great while,&mdash;odd, madam, you have revived
me,&mdash;not since I was five-and-thirty.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Why, you have no great reason to complain, Sir
Sampson, that is not long ago.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Zooks, but it is, madam, a very great while:
to a man that admires a fine woman as much as I do.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re an absolute courtier, Sir Sampson.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Not at all, madam,&mdash;odsbud, you wrong
me,&mdash;I am not so old neither, to be a bare courtier, only a
man of words.&nbsp; Odd, I have warm blood about me yet, and can
serve a lady any way.&nbsp; Come, come, let me tell you, you
women think a man old too soon, faith and troth you do.&nbsp;
Come, don&rsquo;t despise fifty; odd, fifty, in a hale
constitution, is no such contemptible age.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Fifty a contemptible age!&nbsp; Not at all; a very
fashionable age, I think.&nbsp; I assure you, I know very
considerable beaus that set a good face upon fifty.&nbsp;
Fifty!&nbsp; I have seen fifty in a side box by candle-light
out-blossom five-and-twenty.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Outsides, outsides; a pize take &rsquo;em,
mere outsides.&nbsp; Hang your side-box beaus; no, I&rsquo;m none
of those, none of your forced trees, that pretend to blossom in
the fall, and bud when they should bring forth fruit: I am of a
long-lived race, and inherit vigour; none of my ancestors married
till fifty, yet they begot sons and daughters till fourscore: I
am of your patriarchs, I, a branch of one of your antedeluvian
families, fellows that the flood could not wash away.&nbsp; Well,
madam, what are your commands?&nbsp; Has any young rogue
affronted you, and shall I cut his throat?&nbsp; Or&mdash;</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; No, Sir Sampson, I have no quarrel upon my
hands.&nbsp; I have more occasion for your conduct than your
courage at this time.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m
weary of living single and want a husband.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Odsbud, and &rsquo;tis pity you should.&nbsp;
Odd, would she would like me, then I should hamper my young
rogues.&nbsp; Odd, would she would; faith and troth she&rsquo;s
devilish handsome.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Madam, you deserve
a good husband, and &rsquo;twere pity you should be thrown away
upon any of these young idle rogues about the town.&nbsp; Odd,
there&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er a young fellow worth hanging&mdash;that
is a very young fellow.&nbsp; Pize on &rsquo;em, they never think
beforehand of anything; and if they commit matrimony, &rsquo;tis
as they commit murder, out of a frolic, and are ready to hang
themselves, or to be hanged by the law, the next morning.&nbsp;
Odso, have a care, madam.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Therefore I ask your advice, Sir Sampson.&nbsp; I
have fortune enough to make any man easy that I can like: if
there were such a thing as a young agreeable man, with a
reasonable stock of good nature and sense&mdash;for I would
neither have an absolute wit nor a fool.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Odd, you are hard to please, madam: to find a
young fellow that is neither a wit in his own eye, nor a fool in
the eye of the world, is a very hard task.&nbsp; But, faith and
troth, you speak very discreetly; for I hate both a wit and a
fool.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; She that marries a fool, Sir Sampson, forfeits the
reputation of her honesty or understanding; and she that marries
a very witty man is a slave to the severity and insolent conduct
of her husband.&nbsp; I should like a man of wit for a lover,
because I would have such an one in my power; but I would no more
be his wife than his enemy.&nbsp; For his malice is not a more
terrible consequence of his aversion than his jealousy is of his
love.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; None of old Foresight&rsquo;s sibyls ever
uttered such a truth.&nbsp; Odsbud, you have won my heart; I hate
a wit: I had a son that was spoiled among &rsquo;em, a good
hopeful lad, till he learned to be a wit; and might have risen in
the state.&nbsp; But, a pox on&rsquo;t, his wit run him out of
his money, and now his poverty has run him out of his wits.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Sir Sampson, as your friend, I must tell you you
are very much abused in that matter: he&rsquo;s no more mad than
you are.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; How, madam!&nbsp; Would I could prove it.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I can tell you how that may be done.&nbsp; But it
is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concerned in
your affairs.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Odsbud, I believe she likes me.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, madam, all my affairs are scarce worthy
to be laid at your feet; and I wish, madam, they were in a better
posture, that I might make a more becoming offer to a lady of
your incomparable beauty and merit.&nbsp; If I had Peru in one
hand, and Mexico in t&rsquo;other, and the Eastern Empire under
my feet, it would make me only a more glorious victim to be
offered at the shrine of your beauty.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Bless me, Sir Sampson, what&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Odd, madam, I love you.&nbsp; And if you would
take my advice in a husband&mdash;</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Hold, hold, Sir Sampson.&nbsp; I asked your advice
for a husband, and you are giving me your consent.&nbsp; I was
indeed thinking to propose something like it in jest, to satisfy
you about Valentine: for if a match were seemingly carried on
between you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his disguise
of madness, in apprehension of losing me: for you know he has
long pretended a passion for me.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Gadzooks, a most ingenious
contrivance&mdash;if we were to go through with it.&nbsp; But why
must the match only be seemingly carried on?&nbsp; Odd, let it be
a real contract.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Oh, fie, Sir Sampson, what would the world say?</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Say?&nbsp; They would say you were a wise
woman and I a happy man.&nbsp; Odd, madam, I&rsquo;ll love you as
long as I live, and leave you a good jointure when I die.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Ay; but that is not in your power, Sir Sampson: for
when Valentine confesses himself in his senses, he must make over
his inheritance to his younger brother.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Odd, you&rsquo;re cunning, a wary
baggage!&nbsp; Faith and troth, I like you the better.&nbsp; But,
I warrant you, I have a proviso in the obligation in favour of
myself.&nbsp; Body o&rsquo; me, I have a trick to turn the
settlement upon the issue male of our two bodies begotten.&nbsp;
Odsbud, let us find children and I&rsquo;ll find an estate!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Will you?&nbsp; Well, do you find the estate and
leave t&rsquo;other to me.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; O rogue!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll trust you.&nbsp;
And will you consent?&nbsp; Is it a match then?</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Let me consult my lawyer concerning this
obligation, and if I find what you propose practicable,
I&rsquo;ll give you my answer.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; With all my heart: come in with me, and
I&rsquo;ll lend you the bond.&nbsp; You shall consult your
lawyer, and I&rsquo;ll consult a parson.&nbsp; Odzooks, I&rsquo;m
a young man&mdash;odzooks, I&rsquo;m a young man, and I&rsquo;ll
make it appear,&mdash;odd, you&rsquo;re devilish handsome.&nbsp;
Faith and troth, you&rsquo;re very handsome, and I&rsquo;m very
young and very lusty.&nbsp; Odsbud, hussy, you know how to
choose, and so do I.&nbsp; Odd, I think we are very well
met.&nbsp; Give me your hand, odd, let me kiss it; &rsquo;tis as
warm and as soft&mdash;as what?&nbsp; Odd, as t&rsquo;other
hand&mdash;give me t&rsquo;other hand, and I&rsquo;ll mumble
&rsquo;em and kiss &rsquo;em till they melt in my mouth.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Hold, Sir Sampson.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re profuse of
your vigour before your time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll spend your
estate before you come to it.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; No, no, only give you a rent-roll of my
possessions.&nbsp; Ah, baggage, I warrant you for little
Sampson.&nbsp; Odd, Sampson&rsquo;s a very good name for an able
fellow: your Sampsons were strong dogs from the beginning.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Have a care and don&rsquo;t over-act your
part.&nbsp; If you remember, Sampson, the strongest of the name,
pulled an old house over his head at last.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Say you so, hussy?&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s go
then; odd, I long to be pulling too; come away.&nbsp; Odso,
here&rsquo;s somebody coming.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Tattle</span>,
<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Is not that she gone out just now?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Ay, sir; she&rsquo;s just going to the place of
appointment.&nbsp; Ah, sir, if you are not very faithful and
close in this business, you&rsquo;ll certainly be the death of a
person that has a most extraordinary passion for your
honour&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay, who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Even my unworthy self, sir.&nbsp; Sir, I have had
an appetite to be fed with your commands a great while; and now,
sir, my former master having much troubled the fountain of his
understanding, it is a very plausible occasion for me to quench
my thirst at the spring of your bounty.&nbsp; I thought I could
not recommend myself better to you, sir, than by the delivery of
a great beauty and fortune into your arms, whom I have heard you
sigh for.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make thy fortune; say no more.&nbsp;
Thou art a pretty fellow, and canst carry a message to a lady, in
a pretty soft kind of phrase, and with a good persuading
accent.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, I have the seeds of rhetoric and oratory in
my head: I have been at Cambridge.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay; &rsquo;tis well enough for a servant to be
bred at an university: but the education is a little too pedantic
for a gentleman.&nbsp; I hope you are secret in your nature:
private, close, ha?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Oh, sir, for that, sir, &rsquo;tis my chief
talent: I&rsquo;m as secret as the head of Nilus.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s he, though?&nbsp; A privy
counsellor?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; O ignorance!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; A cunning
Egyptian, sir, that with his arms would overrun the country, yet
nobody could ever find out his head-quarters.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Close dog!&nbsp; A good whoremaster, I warrant
him:&mdash;the time draws nigh, Jeremy.&nbsp; Angelica will be
veiled like a nun, and I must be hooded like a friar, ha,
Jeremy?</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Ay, sir; hooded like a hawk, to seize at first
sight upon the quarry.&nbsp; It is the whim of my master&rsquo;s
madness to be so dressed, and she is so in love with him
she&rsquo;ll comply with anything to please him.&nbsp; Poor lady,
I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll have reason to pray for me, when she
finds what a happy exchange she has made, between a madman and so
accomplished a gentleman.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay, faith, so she will, Jeremy: you&rsquo;re a
good friend to her, poor creature.&nbsp; I swear I do it hardly
so much in consideration of myself as compassion to her.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an act of charity, sir, to save a fine
woman with thirty thousand pound from throwing herself away.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis, faith; I might have saved several
others in my time, but, i&rsquo;gad, I could never find in my
heart to marry anybody before.</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Well, sir, I&rsquo;ll go and tell her my
master&rsquo;s coming, and meet you in half a quarter of an hour
with your disguise at your own lodgings.&nbsp; You must talk a
little madly: she won&rsquo;t distinguish the tone of your
voice.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, no; let me alone for a counterfeit.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be ready for you.</p>

<p>MISS.&nbsp; O Mr. Tattle, are you here?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad I
have found you; I have been looking up and down for you like
anything, till I&rsquo;m as tired as anything in the world.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, pox, how shall I get rid of this foolish
girl?&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Oh, I have pure news, I can tell you, pure
news.&nbsp; I must not marry the seaman now&mdash;my father says
so.&nbsp; Why won&rsquo;t you be my husband?&nbsp; You say you
love me, and you won&rsquo;t be my husband.&nbsp; And I know you
may be my husband now, if you please.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, fie, miss; who told you so, child?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Why, my father.&nbsp; I told him that you loved
me.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, fie, miss; why did you do so?&nbsp; And who
told you so, child?</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Why, you did; did not you?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Oh, pox, that was yesterday, miss, that was a
great while ago, child.&nbsp; I have been asleep since; slept a
whole night, and did not so much as dream of the matter.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Pshaw&mdash;oh, but I dreamt that it was so,
though.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay, but your father will tell you that dreams come
by contraries, child.&nbsp; Oh, fie; what, we must not love one
another now.&nbsp; Pshaw, that would be a foolish thing
indeed.&nbsp; Fie, fie, you&rsquo;re a woman now, and must think
of a new man every morning and forget him every night.&nbsp; No,
no, to marry is to be a child again, and play with the same
rattle always.&nbsp; Oh, fie, marrying is a paw thing.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; Well, but don&rsquo;t you love me as well as you
did last night then?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, no, child, you would not have me.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Yes, but I would, though.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Pshaw, but I tell you you would not.&nbsp; You
forget you&rsquo;re a woman and don&rsquo;t know your own
mind.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s my father, and he knows my
mind.</p>
<h3>SCENE V.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>To them</i>] <span
class="smcap">Foresight</span>.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; O Mr. Tattle, your servant, you are a close man;
but methinks your love to my daughter was a secret I might have
been trusted with.&nbsp; Or had you a mind to try if I could
discover it by my art?&nbsp; Hum, ha!&nbsp; I think there is
something in your physiognomy that has a resemblance of her; and
the girl is like me.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; And so you would infer that you and I are
alike?&nbsp; What does the old prig mean?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll banter
him, and laugh at him, and leave him.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp;
I fancy you have a wrong notion of faces.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; A wrong notion?&nbsp; How
so?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; In the way of art: I have some taking features,
not obvious to vulgar eyes, that are indications of a sudden turn
of good fortune in the lottery of wives, and promise a great
beauty and great fortune reserved alone for me, by a private
intrigue of destiny, kept secret from the piercing eye of
perspicuity, from all astrologers, and the stars themselves.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; I will make it appear that what you say
is impossible.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Sir, I beg your pardon, I&rsquo;m in
haste&mdash;</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; For what?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; To be married, sir, married.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Ay, but pray take me along with you,
sir&mdash;</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; No, sir; &rsquo;tis to be done privately.&nbsp; I
never make confidants.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Well, but my consent, I mean.&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t marry my daughter without my consent?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; I, sir?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an absolute
stranger to you and your daughter, sir.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Hey day!&nbsp; What time of the moon is this?</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Very true, sir, and desire to continue so.&nbsp; I
have no more love for your daughter than I have likeness of you,
and I have a secret in my heart which you would be glad to know
and shan&rsquo;t know, and yet you shall know it, too, and be
sorry for&rsquo;t afterwards.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have you to know,
sir, that I am as knowing as the stars, and as secret as the
night.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m going to be married just now, yet did
not know of it half an hour ago; and the lady stays for me, and
does not know of it yet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a mystery for you: I
know you love to untie difficulties.&nbsp; Or, if you can&rsquo;t
solve this, stay here a quarter of an hour, and I&rsquo;ll come
and explain it to you.</p>

<p>MISS.&nbsp; O father, why will you let him go?&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you make him to be my husband?</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Mercy on us, what do these lunacies portend?&nbsp;
Alas! he&rsquo;s mad, child, stark wild.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; What, and must not I have e&rsquo;er a husband,
then?&nbsp; What, must I go to bed to nurse again, and be a child
as long as she&rsquo;s an old woman?&nbsp; Indeed but I
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; For now my mind is set upon a man, I will have
a man some way or other.&nbsp; Oh, methinks I&rsquo;m sick when I
think of a man; and if I can&rsquo;t have one, I would go to
sleep all my life: for when I&rsquo;m awake it makes me wish and
long, and I don&rsquo;t know for what.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;d rather
be always asleep than sick with thinking.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; Oh, fearful!&nbsp; I think the girl&rsquo;s
influenced too.&nbsp; Hussy, you shall have a rod.</p>
<p>MISS.&nbsp; A fiddle of a rod, I&rsquo;ll have a husband; and
if you won&rsquo;t get me one, I&rsquo;ll get one for
myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll marry our Robin the butler; he says he
loves me, and he&rsquo;s a handsome man, and shall be my husband:
I warrant he&rsquo;ll be my husband, and thank me too, for he
told me so.</p>

there&rsquo;s the handsome young woman, she, as they say, brother
Val went mad for, she&rsquo;s mad too, I think.</p>

too?&nbsp; Well, I shall run mad next.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; Well, but how mad?&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye

<p>BEN.&nbsp; Nay, I&rsquo;ll give you leave to guess.&nbsp;

I mayn&rsquo;t say so, neither.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll sail as far
as Leghorn and back again before you shall guess at the matter,
and do nothing else.&nbsp; Mess, you may take in all the points
of the compass, and not hit right.</p>

much time.</p>

<p>FORE.&nbsp; Well, but they are not mad, that is, not
lunatic?</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what you may call madness.&nbsp;

joy, Uncle Foresight, double joy, both as uncle and astrologer;
here&rsquo;s a conjunction that was not foretold in all your

shall.&nbsp; Odd, we&rsquo;ll have the music of the
sphere&rsquo;s for thee, old Lilly, that we will, and thou shalt
lead up a dance in Via Lactea.</p>

you&rsquo;ll be my father, and give me.</p>

<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; This is so surprising.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; What does my aunt say?&nbsp;
Surprising, aunt?&nbsp; Not at all for a young couple to make a
match in winter: not at all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a plot to undermine
cold weather, and destroy that usurper of a bed called a
warming-pan.</p>
<p>MRS. FORE.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to hear you have so much fire
in you, Sir Sampson.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Mess, I fear his fire&rsquo;s little better than
tinder; mayhap it will only serve to light up a match for
somebody else.&nbsp; The young woman&rsquo;s a handsome young
woman, I can&rsquo;t deny it: but, father, if I might be your
pilot in this case, you should not marry her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
just the same thing as if so be you should sail so far as the
Straits without provision.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Who gave you authority to speak, sirrah?&nbsp;
To your element, fish, be mute, fish, and to sea, rule your helm,
sirrah, don&rsquo;t direct me.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Well, well, take you care of your own helm, or you
mayn&rsquo;t keep your new vessel steady.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Why, you impudent tarpaulin!&nbsp; Sirrah, do
you bring your forecastle jests upon your father?&nbsp; But I
shall be even with you, I won&rsquo;t give you a groat.&nbsp; Mr.
Buckram, is the conveyance so worded that nothing can possibly
descend to this scoundrel?&nbsp; I would not so much as have him
have the prospect of an estate, though there were no way to come
to it, but by the North-East Passage.</p>
<p>BUCK.&nbsp; Sir, it is drawn according to your directions;
there is not the least cranny of the law unstopt.</p>
<p>BEN.&nbsp; Lawyer, I believe there&rsquo;s many a cranny and
leak unstopt in your conscience.&nbsp; If so be that one had a
pump to your bosom, I believe we should discover a foul
hold.&nbsp; They say a witch will sail in a sieve: but I believe
the devil would not venture aboard o&rsquo; your

us into one another.</p>

<p>ANG.&nbsp; But I believe Mr. Tattle meant the favour to me: I
thank him.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; I did, as I hope to be saved, madam; my intentions
were good.&nbsp; But this is the most cruel thing, to marry one
does not know how, nor why, nor wherefore.&nbsp; The devil take
me if ever I was so much concerned at anything in my life.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very unhappy, if you don&rsquo;t care
for one another.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; The least in the world&mdash;that is for my part:
I speak for myself.&nbsp; Gad, I never had the least thought of
serious kindness.&mdash;I never liked anybody less in my
life.&nbsp; Poor woman!&nbsp; Gad, I&rsquo;m sorry for her too,
for I have no reason to hate her neither; but I believe I shall

on&rsquo;t, I wish we could keep it secret; why, I don&rsquo;t
believe any of this company would speak of it.</p>
<p>MRS. FRAIL.&nbsp; But, my dear, that&rsquo;s impossible: the
parson and that rogue Jeremy will publish it.</p>
<p>TATT.&nbsp; Ay, my dear, so they will, as you say.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Oh, you&rsquo;ll agree very well in a little time;
custom will make it easy to you.</p>

sleep o&rsquo; your wedding-night?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an older

foul of one another.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for the young man with
all my heart.&nbsp; Look you, friend, if I may advise you, when
she&rsquo;s going&mdash;for that you must expect, I have
experience of her&mdash;when she&rsquo;s going, let her go.&nbsp;

I&rsquo;ll give it under my hand.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Sir, I&rsquo;m come to acknowledge my errors, and
ask your pardon.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; What, have you found your senses at last
then?&nbsp; In good time, sir.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; You were abused, sir: I never was distracted.</p>
<p>FORE.&nbsp; How!&nbsp; Not mad!&nbsp; Mr. Scandal&mdash;</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; No, really, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m his witness; it
was all counterfeit.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I thought I had reasons&mdash;but it was a poor
contrivance, the effect has shown it such.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Contrivance!&nbsp; What, to cheat me? to cheat
your father?&nbsp; Sirrah, could you hope to prosper?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Indeed, I thought, sir, when the father endeavoured
to undo the son, it was a reasonable return of nature.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Very good, sir.&nbsp; Mr. Buckram, are you
ready?&nbsp; Come, sir, will you sign and seal?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; If you please, sir; but first I would ask this lady
one question.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Sir, you must ask me leave first.&nbsp; That
lady?&nbsp; No, sir, you shall ask that lady no questions till
you have asked her blessing, sir: that lady is to be my wife.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I have heard as much, sir; but I would have it from

<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s as much as to say I lie, sir, and
you don&rsquo;t believe what I say.</p>

lately counterfeited madness; I don&rsquo;t know but the frolic
may go round.</p>

pardon me if I think my own inclinations have a better right to
dispose of my person than yours.</p>

you sign and seal?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; With all my heart, sir.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; &rsquo;Sdeath, you are not mad indeed, to ruin
yourself?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I have been disappointed of my only hope, and he
that loses hope may part with anything.&nbsp; I never valued
fortune but as it was subservient to my pleasure, and my only
pleasure was to please this lady.&nbsp; I have made many vain
attempts, and find at last that nothing but my ruin can effect
it; which, for that reason, I will sign to&mdash;give me the
paper.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Generous Valentine!&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>.]</p>
<p>BUCK.&nbsp; Here is the deed, sir.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; But where is the bond by which I am obliged to sign
this?</p>
<p>BUCK.&nbsp; Sir Sampson, you have it.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; No, I have it, and I&rsquo;ll use it as I would
everything that is an enemy to Valentine.&nbsp; [<i>Tears the
paper</i>.]</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; How now?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Ha!</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Had I the world to give you, it could not make me
worthy of so generous and faithful a passion.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
my hand:&mdash;my heart was always yours, and struggled very hard
to make this utmost trial of your virtue.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span

<p>BEN.&nbsp; Mess, here&rsquo;s the wind changed again.&nbsp;
Father, you and I may make a voyage together now.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Well, Sir Sampson, since I have played you a trick,
I&rsquo;ll advise you how you may avoid such another.&nbsp; Learn
to be a good father, or you&rsquo;ll never get a second
wife.&nbsp; I always loved your son, and hated your unforgiving
nature.&nbsp; I was resolved to try him to the utmost; I have
tried you too, and know you both.&nbsp; You have not more faults
than he has virtues, and &rsquo;tis hardly more pleasure to me
that I can make him and myself happy than that I can punish
you.</p>

surprise would make it double.</p>
<p>SIR SAMP.&nbsp; Oons, you&rsquo;re a crocodile.</p>

I&rsquo;m another.</p>

wife, I can spare him mine.&mdash;Oh, are you there, sir?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m indebted to you for my happiness.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.]</p>
<p>JERE.&nbsp; Sir, I ask you ten thousand pardons: &rsquo;twas
an errant mistake.&nbsp; You see, sir, my master was never mad,
nor anything like it.&nbsp; Then how could it be otherwise?</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Tattle, I thank you; you would have interposed
between me and heaven, but Providence laid purgatory in your
way.&nbsp; You have but justice.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; I hear the fiddles that Sir Sampson provided for
his own wedding; methinks &rsquo;tis pity they should not be
employed when the match is so much mended.&nbsp; Valentine,
though it be morning, we may have a dance.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Anything, my friend, everything that looks like joy
and transport.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Call &rsquo;em, Jeremy.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; I have done dissembling now, Valentine; and if that
coldness which I have always worn before you should turn to an
extreme fondness, you must not suspect it.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll prevent that suspicion: for I intend to
dote to that immoderate degree that your fondness shall never
distinguish itself enough to be taken notice of.&nbsp; If ever
you seem to love too much, it must be only when I can&rsquo;t
love enough.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; Have a care of promises; you know you are apt to
run more in debt than you are able to pay.</p>
<p>VAL.&nbsp; Therefore I yield my body as your prisoner, and
make your best on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; The music stays for you.&nbsp; [<i>Dance</i>.]</p>
<p>SCAN.&nbsp; Well, madam, you have done exemplary justice in
punishing an inhuman father and rewarding a faithful lover.&nbsp;
But there is a third good work which I, in particular, must thank
you for: I was an infidel to your sex, and you have converted
me.&nbsp; For now I am convinced that all women are not like
fortune, blind in bestowing favours, either on those who do not
merit or who do not want &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>ANG.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an unreasonable accusation that you lay
upon our sex: you tax us with injustice, only to cover your own
want of merit.&nbsp; You would all have the reward of love, but
few have the constancy to stay till it becomes your due.&nbsp;
Men are generally hypocrites and infidels: they pretend to
worship, but have neither zeal nor faith.&nbsp; How few, like
Valentine, would persevere even to martyrdom, and sacrifice their
interest to their constancy!&nbsp; In admiring me, you misplace
the novelty.</p>
<p class="poetry">The miracle to-day is, that we find<br />
A lover true; not that a woman&rsquo;s kind.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
